# 14.18 - Resolving Association Classes

**Let's look at resolving association classes. When an association class can only exist in the analysis version of the domain model, again an association class is purely conceptual, so there is no programming technique to directly implement this type of concept, therefore association classes should be resolved by some construct that can be implemented during the design. So in this particular case, let's go ahead and imagine a soccer application in which the system must model a game played by two teams. Again relative to a game each team would have a score and a flag indicating whether or not that team had to forfeit. Example again in this case not enough players showed up to play the game. So during analysis this situation is nicely modeled with an association class called a TeamScore, however this association must be resolved during design as most OO languages do not support association classes, so the developer in this case may decide to move the data or the results into the game class, again this solution is feasible because there is a definite number of teams for the game, again two in this case. So the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates this example, where we have again a game and team and we have a team typically there are two teams and then the games they can play more than one game and we see the TeamScore which is pretty much a class that represents in this case the score and the forfeit. And if you refine that actually instead of using the association class, we can actually now look at the game and the team and in this case in the game we actually put team1 and team1Score and the team1Forfeit and then team2 and team2Score and team2Forfeit. Again this figure shows the resolving association classes in this particular case. Again moving again and again staying on with the resolving association classes an alternative strategy is to place the association class in between the two primary classes, so in this case we see how an example that shows us how actually we use an association classes in this case called TeamScore and in the refinement we actually use it between the in this case the two primary classes which in this case the game and the team and we have now in this case TeamScore and an association between TeamScore and a game and an association between TeamScore and a team.**
