**Looking at relationship methods, well, association methods enable the client to access and change associated objects and there are three cases again one-to-one, one- to-many, and many-to-many. So the one to one relationships use a single instance variable reference. For example, the hotel management would like to send out surveys to customers, so the survey class keeps an association to the customer class using an instance variable and accessor and mutator methods and the figure that we see on this slide illustrates this example, so we have a customer and a survey sent to a customer, again in the refinement we can see that in the survey we have the survey class has an attribute of type customer and it has the getter and setter method of the customer getCustomer and setCustomer. Now, looking at the one-to-many relationships, again the one-to- many relationships require the use of collections, for example our hotel property contains multiple rooms, so the property class would store the room objects in a collection objects, again the accessor methods geRooms in this case might return an iterator object which again would enable the client object to iterate over every element in that collection so the addRoom and removeRoom mutator methods modify the collection of rooms and the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates this example, where we have again in this case a relationship between property and room and in the property class and when we refine that we actually see that the property class contains the collection of rooms and we have the getRooms that return pretty much an iterator and we have addRoom and removeRoom that alter the collection or modify the collection. Again as a note, a collection and iterator interfaces are built into the Java SC platform, again other languages have similar mechanisms for working with collections.**
