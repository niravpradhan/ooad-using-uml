**Letâ€™s go ahead and look at choosing an appropriate data type, well, choosing a data type is again a tradeoff. Again it could be representational transparency how well does the data type correspond to the programmers mental model of the attribute. Computational time again how much time is required to convert the data into the representations needed for the user interface or data storage and computational space how much space and bytes does the data require in memory again this issue is very important for small devices like cell phones and PDAs and so forth. Again you know looking at the choosing an appropriate data type so well the table that we see on the slide illustrates a few of the issues in selecting a data type to again represent a Phone Number attribute. So if the data type is String again the discussion would be this data type might require mapping between the user interface representation and the storage database representation. For again a long type this data type conserves space, but might not be sufficient to represent large Phone Numbers, again such as international numbers. Phone Number again a value object is a class that represent the phone data. Again this data type representationally transparent, but requires additional quality. And character array would be the again this data type is similar to a String and adds no value, and of course, the integer array would be again this type conserve space, but is not representationally transparent.**
