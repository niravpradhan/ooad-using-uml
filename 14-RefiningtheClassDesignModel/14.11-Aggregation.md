**Letâ€™s go ahead and look at aggregation, well, aggregation is a special form of association that specifies a whole-par between the aggregate whole and a component part. Again the distinction between an association and aggregation is largely semantic. There is no functional difference between the implementation of these two relationship types. Again in this example we see that the diagram that we see on the figure that we see on this current slide pretty much illustrates an example of aggregation. So in the analysis we have reservation and room and in the refinement we actually can see that in this particular case room no reservation again it can actually have more than one room. So in this case we can actually see that the reservation or particularly the room is actually an attribute of the class reservation and it has its own accessor and mutator method getRoom and setRoom.**
