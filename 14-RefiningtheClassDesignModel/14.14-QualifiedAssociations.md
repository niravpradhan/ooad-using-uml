**Let's go ahead and look now at qualified associations. Well, in the one-to-many or many-to-many associations it is often useful to actually model how the system will access a single element in the association, so again an association attribute or tubble of attributes whose values partition the set of objects related to an object across an association, this is how typically we specify a qualified association. And on the figure that we see in this slide it actually show illustrates again this name can be used to qualify the association. In this case we make use of the qualification name to represent that so we have between room and property again we make use of the name to actually that can be used to qualify the association.**
