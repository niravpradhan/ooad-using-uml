**Let's go ahead and look at refining methods, well, methods are identified during the again the following activities. We identify methods through CRC analysis, again which determines the responsibilities, we also identify methods with robustness analysis, which identifies methods in the service classes and of course, we identify methods through design which identifies accessor indicator methods for attribute and attributes, and of course, associations. Other types of methods again can be found in the object management, again this type of methods perform tasks that relate to the management of the object within the programming language. Unit testing again we can supply specific methods in our classes to perform unit testing, recovery inverse, and complimentary operations again recovery methods provide means to recover from a complex operations, again such methods are often used by the user interface and it is to provide a way to actually undo an operation and here is the UML syntax for a method declaration so we see that we have the visibility which is again optional here, the name and then of course, the parameter types, or the parameters and the types of the parameters that we pass to the method and the return value again could be optional and of course, the constraints.**
