# 14.12 - Composition

**Letâ€™s go and now look at composition, well, a composition in the form of aggregation that requires that a part instance be included in at most one composite at a time, and that the composite object is responsible for the creation and destruction of the part. So the distinction between an aggregation and a composition is semantically similar, but functionally different. In general, the parts of a composition are not accessible outside of the whole object. For example, it might be important to model the payment for reservation as a composition in which the reservation object is in complete control over the creation and the structure of the payment object. Again to modify the information about a payment the reservation class must have methods to modify the data within the payment object. Again in the figure that we see on this current slide illustrates the example of composition, again we see the reservation and the payment so in the refinement we can see that the payment is an attribute of the reservation and again for the accessors we have getPayType, we have getPayNumber, get PayAmount and from the mutators we have the setPayType, setPayNumber, and the setPayAmount.**
