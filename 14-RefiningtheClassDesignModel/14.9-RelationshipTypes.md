**So looking at the relationship types, there are three types of relationships actually. We have association, aggregation, and composition. Again these relationships imply that the related object is somehow tied to the original object usually as an instance attribute. Again there is another type of relationship, Depencdency, which again states that one object uses another object to do some work, but there is no instance attribute holding that particular object.**
