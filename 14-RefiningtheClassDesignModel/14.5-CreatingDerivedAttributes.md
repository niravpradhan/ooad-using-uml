**Let’s go ahead and look at creating derived attributes. Well, in analysis again we might have an attribute that we know can be derived from another more stable source. Again the economical example is the calculation of a person’s age from their date of birth. Again a derived attribute is represented with the forward slash character in front of the attribute name and the figure that we see in this particular slide illustrates this, so in this particular case we see how the age actually is a derived attribute from the again date of birth.**
