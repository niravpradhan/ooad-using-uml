**Letâ€™s go ahead and look at association, well, the semantic relationship between two or more classifiers that specifies connections among their instances. So an association is a relationship in which one object holds a reference to another object as an instance variable and the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates an example of association. So in the analysis we have a customer and survey, again the survey sent to a customer and if we refine that then we actually see that in the survey class it actually has an attribute that is an object of type customer. And of course, it has its own accessories and mutator setCustomer and getCustomer.**
