**So again looking at refining those attribute metadata again like we said an attribute declaration in UML Class Diagrams include the name, its visibility, its type, multiplicity, initial values, and of course, the constraint which is again one of changeable add only or frozen. And here is the syntax again of the for an attribute declaration. So we have the visibility again that is between the square braces or square brackets means it is optional. So we have the visibility, we have the name and multiplicity, the type, the initial value and of course the constraints. And the figure that we see on this current slide illustrates a refinement of the customer class in which again the attributes are fully specified. Again in this design the first and last names of a customer cannot be changed after the object is created because they are set as frozen. Also the phone attribute supports one or two phone number objects again one for the customersâ€™ home and one for the work phone number.**
