**Let's go ahead and now look at creating components with interfaces. Well, classes can be grouped into cohesive components with well defined provided and required interfaces. Again the figure that we see on this particular slide shows an example of lending library system where all the classes related to memberships are again grouped into the membership component. So the MemberService class is split into the MemberService interface which again is shown in the diagram as provided interface and the MemberService implementation class, which again contains the implementation and is again hidden inside the component.**
