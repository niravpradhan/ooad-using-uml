**Letâ€™s go ahead and look now at navigation, When a navigation arrow shows the direction of object reversal at runtime. Again the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates that there are three fundamental forms of navigation. We have the implicit bidirectional relationship. We have the explicit bidirectional relationship where we actually we see the arrows on both sides and we have the explicit unidirectional relationship. We actually could be from a property to a room or from a room to a property. So navigation implies having accessor methods again in bidirectional relationship both classes will have accessor methods. Continuing with navigation again sometimes in a large sys you do not know what direction the software we need to navigate the association. Again this program should be resolved in a design. So in this particular case again looking at for example the business analyst might not have determined if a payment object could be navigated back to its corresponding reservation object. Again therefore the analyst left the again relationship as implicitly bidirectional, however through robustness analysis, the design team decided that it is only necessary to navigate from the reservation object to the payment object and we see this in the figure that we see on this current slide that illustrates the appropriate navigation they particularly assign in this case the navigation is from reservation to payment.**
