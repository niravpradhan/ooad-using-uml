**So in summary for this particular module, we actually looked at the Design Workflow and again we said that during the Design Workflow we must refine the Domain model to reflect the implementation paradigm. Again this module described how to refine the Domain model features like attributes, relationships, methods, constructors, and method behavior by using annotations. We also looked at the classes that should be reviewed to ensure that they maintain high cohesion and low coupling. And we looked at classes that can be grouped into cohesive components with well-defined interfaces.**
