# 14.21 - Declaring Constructors

**Let's go ahead and look at declaring constructors, well, constructors use similar syntax as methods and are similar to methods except that there is no return type. Also in Java technology, the name of the constructor is the name as the class name or the same as the class name. Because constructors look very much like methods, it is a good practice to separate the constructor or the constructors from the methods using the constructor stereotype. Again in many languages you are provided with a default constructor, which again take no arguments. And they are looking at the class that we see on this current slide which is the customer class, it has a bunch of attributes and then inside again firstName, lastName, address, and phone and there are all private and of course, in addition to the accessors and mutators, we actually specify also the constructors and then in this case we have a couple of constructors one that takes two strings, one that plays a role of a first name and the second the last name and the second constructor it takes actually first name as a string, the last name as a string and of course, an address as an object of type address. And we see how we specify these using the stereotype constructor that we see above the two constructors that we see on this class.**
