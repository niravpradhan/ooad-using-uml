**Now, let's go ahead and look at reviewing cohesion. Again ideally your model should actually have the highest cohesion. And cohesion by the way is a matter of degree, however more cohesive components tend to be easier to understand. Again code, test, and of course, adapt to future requirements. In the figure that we see on this particular slide shows an example of a lending library system. Again in the lower cohesion version the member and loan details are in the same class where as the member and loan details means separated in the higher cohesion version.**
