# 14.22 - Reviewing Coupling

**Let's look now at reviewing coupling, well, ideally our model should have the lowest link while maintaining the function requirements and the non-functional requirements. Again coupling is a method of degree. On the figure that we see on this current slide it shows two versions of the lending library system. One with very high coupling and the other with very low coupling and again in the low coupling version it would be quick and easy to access the book class from the loan class. And of course, but slower and more complex to actually access the loan class from the book class. Again in a very high coupling version the access would be quick and easy in both directions. However, the code to add alone would be more complex and slower as both book and loan will need to be updated. In addition, if adding a loan needs to be performed automatically in multithreaded system it would actually be more complex and might have a negative impact on performance. Again in this case we see the high coupling, the very high coupling, and the low coupling. And as a note we should say that the low coupling shown on the figure might not be the lowest coupling possible.**
