**And let's go ahead and look at resolving the many-to-many association. So first let's consider dropping the many-to-many requirements during design, again, for example, an automotive software system might need to model people and the cars they own, so clearly in the analysis we might decide that any person can own multiple cars and any car might be owned by multiple people at different times again, however if the software you are creating is for a car dealership then it is not important to recall the history of owners for a given car, again the system just needs to recall who bought the car, again in this situation there is no requirement for many to many relationships, so during the design the team decides to draw up this requirement and again the figure that we see in this particular case can actually be the relationship between the person and then the car. Again if the many-to-many association must be preserved then we can actually sometimes add a class in between the two classes that reduces the single-many-to-many association to two, one-to-many association, so in our person to car example, if the software needs to recall the complete ownership history for a car, then an additional class which is called the ownership could be introduced to resolve the many-to-many relationship and this is illustrated in the example or in the diagram that we see or the figure that we see on this current slide, so again in the analysis we know that we have a person that can own many cars and the car can be owned by more than one person and if we actually resolve that many-to-many association, it actually we can put an ownership class and then we now have the relationship between the person and ownerships to presume one-to-many and then the many to one would be the relationship between the ownership and the car.**
