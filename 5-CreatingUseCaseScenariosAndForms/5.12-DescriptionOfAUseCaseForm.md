**Let us look now at the Description of a Use Case Form. Well a Use Case form provides a tool to record the detailed analysis of a single use case and its scenarios. The table on this slide lists the elements of the Use Case form and they are Use Case Name, which is the name of the Use Case form and of course the Description which is a one line or two line description of the purpose of the use case. The Actors, which pretty much represent a list of all the relevant Actors that are permitted to use this. Use Case Priority, which is used to describe the relative priority of this particular use case. And of course the risk which is in, it could be a high, medium, or low ranking of this use cases Risk factor. Continuing with the again the use case form, the next element would be the Pre-condition and assumptions, again this would be the conditions that must be true and of course if these conditions are not true, the outcome of the use case cannot be predicted. The Extension Points to the list of any extension points used by the use case. Extends which is a list of any use cases that this use case extends. Trigger would be the condition that informs the actor that the use case should be involved. Flow of Events, which is again the primary trace of user actions and events that constitute this use case. Alternate Flows would be any and all secondary traces of a user actions and events that are possible in this use case. And Post-conditions would be the conditions that shall exist after the use case has been completed. The next element would be the Business Rules, again this would be a list of business rules that must be complied with of course and that are related to the use case. The next element would be the Non-Functional Requirements that list of the non-functional requirements that are related to the use case. And of course Notes would be any other information that can be of value regarding this use case. Let us look now at the description of a use case form, well some methodologies recommend more or less analysis of the use cases. Again the analysis workflow represented in this module tends to be more detailed and of course use case forms are not standard, so there are different styles that can actually be used to create the use case form.s**
