**Looking at Selecting Use Case Scenarios. While it is ideal to have multiple scenarios for all use cases doing so would take a lot of time, therefore we can actually select appropriate use cases for scenario creation by using the criterias that are the use case involves a complex interaction with an actor. Again for true use cases, it might be sufficient to document only a single successful scenario and of course the use case has several potential failure points such as an interaction with external systems or database for example one failure point is that the customerâ€™s credit card does not have the necessary funds to confirm the reservation and of course there are two types of scenarios, they are the primary scenarios that we call successful results and the secondary scenarios that we call failure events.**
