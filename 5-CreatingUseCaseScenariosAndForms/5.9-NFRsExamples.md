**Here are some non-functional requirements examples. Well the non-functional requirement 1 says the system must support 200 simultaneous users in the web application. The non-functional requirement 2 says the process for competing or rather completing any reservation activity must take the average user no more than 10 minutes to finish. And the non-functional requirement 3 says the capacity of reservation records could grow to 2600 per month. The non-functional requirement number 4 says the web access should use the HTTPS transport layer when critical customer information is being commercial or rather communicated. Again in this case they are thinking, they are looking at the security of the transport protocol. The non-functional requirements 5 says the numerical accuracy of all financial calculations for example reports and customer service receipts should follow a 2-significant digit precision with standard routing for intermediate results. Non-functional requirements 6 says the system must be available 7by 24 by 365, however the application can be shutdown for maintenance once a week for 1 hour. Again, this maintenance activity should be scheduled between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.; when it is of course slow. Non-functional requirements 7 says based on historical evidence there are approximately 600 reservations per month per property and non-functional requirement number 8 says the search for available rooms must take no longer than 30 seconds.**
