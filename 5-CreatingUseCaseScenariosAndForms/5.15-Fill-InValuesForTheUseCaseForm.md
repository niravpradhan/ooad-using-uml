**Let us go ahead and look at filling values for the use case form. Again filling elements from the information already gathered or by reviewing these forms with the stakeholders to add or enhance the requirements and this particular table shows us a partial example of a use case form for the Create Reservation use case, what we have the form element which is a Use Case Name that would be a Create Reservation. Description would be the customer request reservation for hotel rooms, for date range. Again if all the requested rooms are available, the price is calculated and offered to the customer if details of the customer and a payment guarantee are provided, the reservation would be confirmed to the customer. In terms of the Actors, we have the primary who is the Booking Agent, Online Booker, Travel Agent System; secondary: none, and of course note here would be a primary actors or proxies are for the customer. Of course, for the Priority in this case it must have essential to the system. For the Risk again it is high, primarily because of the complexity of identifying if rooms are available and the number of different Actor roles that can use this use case. For the Trigger, a customer wishes to make reservations in a hotel. For Pre-conditions at least one room exist in the hotel. Again, primary actor can be identified. For Post-conditions, one reservation is added and the payment guarantee details are recorded. For Non-Functional Requirements here we have the number 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Again 1 related to Simultaneous Users, 2 to Duration of the Use Case, 4 for the Web Security, 6 for System Availability, 8 for Maximum Time for Room Availability Search, and as Notes we have a fast method of checking room availability is still under investigation.**
