**Continuing with the again use case form, the number 8 would be determine the flow of events from the primary scenario, next determine the alternate flows from the secondary scenarios, next determine the business rules from scenarios and from discussions with the stakeholders then after that determine the post conditions, after that we need to determine the new functional requirements from discussions with stakeholders, and then add notes for information again gathered from discussions with stakeholders, that does not fit into the standard sections of the form.**
