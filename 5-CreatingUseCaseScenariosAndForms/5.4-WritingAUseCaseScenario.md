**Now looking at Writing a Use Case Scenario. Well a use case scenario is a story that again describes how an actor uses the system and how the system responds to the actions of the actor. Of course to say that a use case scenario is a story is a great metaphor, a story has all of the characteristics that were described about scenarios and of course a use case scenario has a beginning, a middle, and an end.**
