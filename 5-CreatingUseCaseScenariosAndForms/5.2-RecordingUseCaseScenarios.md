**Let us look at Recording Use Case scenarios. Well a use case represents a system behavior from the actor's perspective. A Use Case scenario is a concrete example of a use case that is a single instance of an actor interacting with the use case. The Use Case scenarios can be of course derived from existing business practices or from observing the use case of an existing system. And a Use Case scenario should again be as specific as possible. It should never contain conditional statements again we should never have a scenario that includes an if statement. It should begin the same way but has different outcomes, it should not specify too many user interface details, it should show successful as well as unsuccessful outcomes in different scenarios, again it is important to write scenarios in which the outcomes are unsuccessful as well as those that were successful. Of course, record these different scenarios. In Use Case scenarios drive several other object analysis or Object Oriented Analysis and Design workflows, Use Case scenarios are primarily used to create use case forms and test plans. They may also be used in the creation of activity diagrams and object diagrams.**
