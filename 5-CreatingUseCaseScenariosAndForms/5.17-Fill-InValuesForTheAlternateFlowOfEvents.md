**Looking now at filling values for the alternate flow of events, again we determine the alternate flows from the secondary scenarios and remaining primary scenarios. Of course, we performed a difference analysis between the scenario used for the main flow and each of the other scenarios in term. Because the alternate flow typically is the steps that are different between the scenario used for the main flow and each of the other scenarios. Let us look at filling values for the alternate flow of events. Again in this case, the A1 would be the customer can enter duration instead of departure date go again to step 2.1, A2 fail date checks, again business rule one. Notify error to customer go to step 2. A3 complying with business rule 2. System determines that required rooms are not available. System upgrades one or more room types. Go to step 2.1 A4, no further upgrades available, notify message to customer. Go to step 2. A5 rooms offered are declined go to step A9. A6 customer already exist, customer enters customer name and zip code. System searches for matching customers notifies customer of matching customers. Again, customer selects correct customer details go to step 3.2. A 7 payment guarantee fails notify message to customer, go to step 3.2. A8 existing customer not found, go to step 3.1. A 9 reservation not confirmed the reservation deleted use case ends. At any time customer may cancel the use case, use case ends, of course after use case in activity of 10 minutes, the use case ends that would be for the time out.**
