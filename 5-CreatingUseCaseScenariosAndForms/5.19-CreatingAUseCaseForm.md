**After looking at creating use case scenarios and forms where we discussed recording use case scenarios, we looked at handling supplementary specifications for non-functional requirements, a glossary of terms, and we also looked at creating a use case form where we again looked at the Description of the use case form and of course creating a use case form. Let us look at an example where we actually see how we create a use case form. Well in this particular case the Use Case Name is Check In and the Description in this case would be the customer arrives at the hotel and provides information to find an existing reservation. Again the customer is given the option to upgrade or change rooms. A further payment guarantee may be required. Again upon successful check-in and the electronic room key is cut, the room phone in enabled, the new bill is created, and the quoted prize is charged to the customerâ€™s bill. Again, we looked at the Actors in this case the Primary would be the Receptionist, there is no Secondary and of course we should not that Primary Actors are proxies for the Customer. In terms of the Priority, again we must have that and the note is essential to the system. Risk is Medium. The Pre- conditions & Assumptions here is that at least one room exist in the hotel and again the Primary Actor can be identified. In terms of Extension Points here we have the Rooms Upgrade, the Change Assigned Rooms, and of course Payment guarantee. In the Extends, we have None. Trigger in this case would be a Customer wishes to check-in the hotel using an existing reservation. And the Main Flow here we see that again Main Flow of Events would be, first Use Case starts when the Customer requests to check-in into the hotel. Receptionist enter the reservation number. System searches for matching reservation. System notifies the Receptionist in the reservation details. Extension Points in this case change Assigned Rooms. Rceptionist accepts that rooms are correct. And of course, Extension Point in this case the Payment Guarantee. System marks reservation status has been check-in. Again, the system applies some Business Rule and marks. Again in this case 21 and marks assigned room has been occupied. The next one is Include again Create again Electronic Keys, and of course there is a number include that pretty much Change Room Telephone Status to enable it. And then system creates the bit for reservation. System applies the Business Rule 22 to add quarter charge for the rooms to be billed as chargeable item of quarter room charge type. Again system marks bill along the additional chargeable items and system indicates that check-in is complete. In terms of the Alternate Flow of Events, the Receptionist enter Customer name again goes to step 2.1. No matching reservation found. Notified Receptionist again to go to step 2. System finds more than one matching reservation systems, displays summary of its reservation found, Receptionist in this case selects the valid reservation go to again then step 2.2. Again the receptionist enters the that none of the reservations were valid. Again, we go to step 2 Receptionist does not accept that rooms are correct. Go to step 2.3 and again no Payment Guarantee for additional charges marks bill us as allowing additional chargeable items and of course rooms changed again go 2.2. No Payment Guarantee for additional charges. Do not change phone status to enable. Again in this case Actor may cancel the use case are use case and of course in this particular case. In terms of Post-conditions, Reserved rooms are not has marked as being occupied. Reservation is marked as being check-in. Bill is marked with payment status; the initial charge is added to the bill. For the Business Rules, we have the Business Rule 2.21 which again reserved means or sales, reserved rules must be marked as being occupied at check-in and of course Business Rule 22, Quoted prize for the stay must be added to the bill on check-in. In terms of Non-Functional Requirements, we have again in this case the Simultaneous Users, Duration of the Use Case, and of course, System Availability. It has to be always available. In terms of nodes, upgrade rooms can be accomplished using change room. Now let us go ahead and look next to the supplementary specification document, so here we have the nonfunctional requirement 3.2 that is a system must support six simultaneous check-in operations per property and non- functional requirement 3.3 the check-in use case must take no longer than five minutes to complete. The non-functional requirement 6, the system must be available 7 by24 by 365. Again however, the applications can be shutdown for maintenance once a week for one hour. Again this maintenance activity should be scheduled between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., again on, when everything is quite. Now we finish by looking at the Abstract of Glossary of Terms. So here we have a bunch of terms and definitions that we can add to the glossary of terms. So we have the Reservation Number which is a unique numeric identifier assigned to a reservation. We have a Reservation Status, again marks the status of reservation and the status include New, Health, Confirm, Checking and Check-Out. We have the bill that contains a list of chargeable items added to the reservation bill. We have Chargeable item that is again the amount, date and type of Chargeable item. We have Chargeable item type. Again the type of charge may to the bill for example beverage, food, room on newspaper. We have the quote room charge again the amount quoted for the chosen room types for the duration of the stay, and of course, we have the Room Status which we course the status of room. For example, occupied available or unserviceable.**
