**Let us look at an example of a secondary use case scenario. Again, within the context of the hotel reservation, so the beginning says the use case begins when the booking agent receives a request to make a reservation for rooms in the hotel. The middle says the booking agent enters the arrival date, the departed date and the quantity of each type of room that is required. The booking agent then submits the entered details. The system responds that there are no rooms available of any type for the date, range specified in the request. Of course in this case the use case ends.**
