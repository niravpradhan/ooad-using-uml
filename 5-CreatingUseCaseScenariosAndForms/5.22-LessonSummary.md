**So for summary of this module, we looked at the Use Case scenario, which is written to provide a detailed description of the activities invoked in one instance of the use case, also looked at the Use Case scenarios that should provide as many different situations as possible, so that the whole range of activities for that use case are documented. We looked at Use Case scenarios that provide much detail about the use case of course an analysis of this details is recorded in the Use Case form and we looked at the activities of a use case that are again distilled into a flow of events portion of the use case form and of course alternate flows are identical or rather identified from unusual situations in one or more scenarios.**
