**For the Non-Functional Requirements, again they define the qualitative characteristics of the system, as in an animal the non-functional requirements describe strength, speed and agility of the internal features of the animal. How fast can the animal move, and how much weight can the animal carry? Of course, any adverbial phrase can be a Non-Functional Requirement.**
