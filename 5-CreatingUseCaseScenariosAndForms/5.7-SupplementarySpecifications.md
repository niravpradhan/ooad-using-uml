# 5.7 - Supplementary Specifications

**Let us look now at Supplementary Specifications. Well some of the project information that you gather cannot be stored with the use cases because this information needs to be shared by several other use cases. Again some of the project information is often shared by two or more of the use cases. Again, this additional information can be documented in a supplementary specification document, which often contains the Non-Functional Requirements, the Project Risks, Project Constraints and Glossary of Terms. Of course, Project Risks and Constraints will be discussed later.**
