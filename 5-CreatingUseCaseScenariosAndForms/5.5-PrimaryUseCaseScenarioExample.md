**Let us look at an example that shows us a primary use case scenario. Again, this is within the context of the hotel room reservation. So it has the beginning that says the use case begins when the booking agent receives a request to make a reservation for rooms in the hotel. The middle says that the booking agent enters the arrival date, the departed date, and the quantity of each type of room that is required. The booking agent then submits the entered details. The system finds rooms that will be available during the period of the reservation and allocates the required number of type of rooms from the available rooms. The system responds that the specified rooms are available, returns the provisional reservation number and marks the reservation as held. The booking agent accepts the rooms offered. More of the middle, the booking agent just selects that the customer has visited one of the hotels in this group before and enters the zip code and the customer name. The system finds and returns a list of matching customers with full address details. The booking agent selects one of the customers as being the valid customer, the system assigns this customer to the reservation, the booking agent performs a payment guarantee check and the check is of course this check is successful. Let us look at the end of this primary use case scenario. The system assigns the payment guarantee to the reservation and changes the state of the reservation to confirm. The system returns the reservation ID and booking details.**
