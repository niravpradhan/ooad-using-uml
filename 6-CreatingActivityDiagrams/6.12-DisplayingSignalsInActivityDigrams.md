**Let us look now at an example of Displaying Signals in Activity Diagrams. Well the figure that we see on the current slide shows an example where Order Details are represented for Confirmation. So if the Accept Order signal is received within 10 minutes of the Order Details being presented, then the order is processed. When the Process Order activity is completed, the Raise Invoice signal is sent. If the Accept Order signal is not received within 10 minutes of being presented, then the Cancel Order activity will commence.**
