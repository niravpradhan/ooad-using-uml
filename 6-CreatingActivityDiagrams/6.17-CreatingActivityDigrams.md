**After looking at creating activity diagrams where we looked at first of all the description of a use case diagram with an activity diagram, we also identified the elements of an activity diagram, and we created an activity diagram for a use case. Let us go ahead and look at an example that illustrates the concepts and features that we learnt. Again, we start with this current activity diagram that we see on the current slide that represent a complex set of activities and we actually look at it as one activity node in the main activity diagram. So we look at this as the main activity diagram and then after that we will show the internal activities in another activity diagram. So looking at this we see the Pre CheckIn Activities in this case, where again we have the CheckIn Start node from it will go through the Pre CheckIn Activities, and of course in the Pre CheckIn Activities where we can again that lead us to the Post CheckIn Activities or inside or next to the Pre CheckIn Activities, we can actually cancel also the Pre CheckIn Activity and that will lead us to Notifying the Receptionist to Restart the CheckIn. And of course, they all end with the Activity Final. Looking at the system or from the system point of view or at least the system side, we can see that in the Post CheckIn Start, we again move towards the Change Reservation Status to Check-In. From it we again go to the next activity which is the Change the Status of Reserved Rooms to Occupy and next activity would be to again Include or Create what we call Electronic Room Keys that would be through the Include. And then that will lead to the next Include dependency which is Change the Room Telephone Status, and then of course, the next activity in this case would be to Create a Bill For Reservation and the next activity would be to the Add Quoted Charge to the Bill. Again and of course, we see now a guard, where we can look at the Payment Guarantee for additional chargeable items or it could be no Payment Guarantee for additional chargeable items. If it is again the Payment Guarantee for additional chargeable items is true then we will go ahead and move to the next activity which is change the bill status to chargeable. On the other hand if no Payment Guarantee for Additional Chargeable Items is set then we move to the next activity in this case which is Notify Receptionist. Again and the CheckIn is complete. Now the next activity shows us both. If we take a look at this activity, we actually look at the receptionist and the system, and we see that how the Receptionist interact with the System Activities. Again looking at the Pre Checking Start. Again we look at first of all through the Request of the Reservation Number Search. Again, we can do it through the Reservation Number Search or we can actually do a request through the name search. So if it is following the Reservation Number Search, then we move to the next activity where we enter the Reservation Number and if you are going and making use of the name of the Customer then we enter the Customer Name. Of course both of them will talk to the activity on the system side which is the Search for Matching Reservation. And of course if there is no match then we will Notify Receptionist that no matching reservation found. On the other hand if more than one matching then in this case we move to the next activity which is Notify Receptionist of Summary of Matching Reservations, and of course from that activity we will go back to the activity on the receptionist side which is again selecting the matching reservation, but if we actually see a one matching and that is on the system side, then this will lead us to the next activity in this case which is Notify the Receptionist of Reservation Details. Of course the next one will be we look at the next activity which is in this case look at the Extension Point in this case change assigned rooms. So of course if the rooms are changed then we notify receptionist of the reservation details and if rooms are not changed then again we move to the next activity on the receptionist side which is a response. Of course this will lead us to again and if rooms not accepted then automatically we will again go to the Extension Point where we change assign rooms and of course if the rooms are accepted then we move to the next activity which is on the system side below which is Extension Point Payment Guarantee and that would again once the Payment Guarantee is done then we end the Pre CheckIn.**
