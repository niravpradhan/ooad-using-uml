**Let us look now at Partitions in Activity Diagrams. Well an activity diagram can show objects grouped into partitions. Partitions are labelled to represent the name of the group. And partitions can be either vertical or horizontal or both vertical and horizontal. The figure that we see on this current slide illustrates an example of vertical partitions where we have first sales, and then the next one manufacture, and the third one order dispatch.**
