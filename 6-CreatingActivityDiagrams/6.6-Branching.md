**In terms of the branching, we say that the branch and merge nodes represent conditional flows of activity. Again, a branch node has two or more outflows with Boolean predicates to indicate the selection condition like we see on the current slide. And a merge mode collapses conditional branches. And we see how in this particular figure that we see on the current slide we got to retrieve customer activities and then next we got the branching where if no customer found we will go ahead and go to the left and make a new customer and otherwise if the customer is found then we will move forward.**
