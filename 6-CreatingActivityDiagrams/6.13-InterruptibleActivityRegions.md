**Let us look now at the Interruptible Activity Region. Well an activity diagram can show a subset of activities that can be interrupted by an event. So on receipt of an accept event or accept time event that occurs within the defined interruptible activity region, the current flow stops and the flow continues from the interrupting event element. The figure that we see on this current slide shows an example where an order can be cancelled at anytime until it is ready to be shipped and that is why on this diagram, we see actually how we have a region representing the cancel order region.**
