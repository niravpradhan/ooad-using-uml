**Looking at the Concurrent Flow of Control. Well we use the fork and joint bar to indicate concurrent flows. As we see on the current slide on the figure that is on the current slide. Well fork and join bars can represent either a threaded activities or parallel user activities, so the fork and join bars can actually represent two distinct types of behavior. First one is the fork and join can represent threaded or truly concurrent activities within a computer system or the fork and join can represent a set of activities that can happen in any non-specified order.**
