**Let us look now at Signals in Activity Diagrams. Well an activity diagram can show the receiving of a signal again using an Accept Event Action, element or an Accept Time Event element is used to show the receiving of a signal. And a Send Event Action element is used to show the sending of a signal. Of course, the resource of the signal is often external to the current activity diagram. And the time event is triggered at a specified time or after a time interval. An activity diagram can show the sending of a signal using a Send Event Action element of course.**
