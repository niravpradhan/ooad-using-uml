**We look at an example, which is Example number 1 of Creating Activity Diagram. Well in the slide that we see next, it is going to illustrate a simple sequence of activities for a part of the Create Reservation Use Case. Again, the diagram shows the activities involved in identifying the customer by either delegating the entry of the new customer details to the extension point the new customer, or by the actor entering a subset of customer information in order to find the existing customer. Of course, if no existing customer is found then the extension point (New Customer) is used. And we can see that on this example which is represented on this current slide where we start off in again the, Identify the Customer Activity again, Request Customer Detail. From it, we get into the condition where if it is a new customer, we will go through the extension point to create a new customer. If the customer is existing, we will continue by Entering Existing Customer Name post code and then after that we will go ahead and Find the Matching Customers. And again, at that time we will choose the correct customer and we move forward.**
