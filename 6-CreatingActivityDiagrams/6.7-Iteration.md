**Looking at Iterations, well we can achieve iteration by using branch nodes. Again, we see in this current slide we see a couple of examples. One is an iteration that makes use of the While-Do Loop and the other one that makes use of the Do-While Loop. So again, the first example that we see on the left side maps closely to the While-Do Loop in which the loop tests is performed before the loop body. The second one, which is on the right maps closely to the Do-While Loop in which the loop body is performed at least once before the loop test is performed.**
