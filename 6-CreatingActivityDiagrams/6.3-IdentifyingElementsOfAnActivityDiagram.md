**Let us identify the elements of an activity diagram. Well an activity diagram represents the sequence of actions or activities with a definite beginning and an end point. And the figure that we see on the current slide shows the essential elements of an activity diagram. So we got the Start node, the Flow of activity, an Activity which like for example retrieve a customer, we have a Guard condition like for example no customer. We have the Branch node; again, where you either have no customer and you create, you make a new customer as you just move forward. And then another again Merge node that we see on the diagram and of course the Stop node. Let us identify continuing with the identification of the elements of an activity diagram and need this again current slide we see that an activity diagrams can also represent simultaneous activities in which the activities can be performed in any order. Again, concurrent activities are illustrated with the Fork and Join bar. This motion can indicate a truly parallel activity as in this case of multi-processor systems or it can indicate a set of activities with no specific order. The figure that we see on this current slide illustrates an example of using Fork and Join bar. So we see how from the Fork, we have three different processes or threads or activities. In this case, enter a name, enter an address, and enter a phone number. And then we see how the Join bar, join them together.**
