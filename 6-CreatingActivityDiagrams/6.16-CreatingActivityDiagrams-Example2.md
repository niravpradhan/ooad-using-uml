**We see another example too, which is example number 2 that actually represents which is going to be represented in the next slide and it shows an activity diagram that represents the main flow path and the alternate flow path of the Create Reservation Use Case Form. And we can see it here illustrated, what in this case again we see how it moves from the partition Actor to the partition System. So we start by again entering the reservation details. Again will lead us to the next step, which is either valid or invalid. And then after that we will create a new reservation and that again lead us to the next step which is finding rooms. Again we could either move to the Upgrade Room or next calculate the prize and the record the price. Once after that we move directly to the Offer Rooms, which again will give us next to the Response. Response comes back with either again identifying the customer accept and identify the customer or again delete the unconfirmed reservation. Next we again while trying to identify the customer, we have an Extension Point which is now related to the Payment Guarantee which again calls the Confirm Reservation which next again cause the notify confirmed reservation details. Of course, we have at any point in time we can actually Cancel the reservation.**
