**Let us look at Describing a Use Case With an Activity Diagram. Well because use cases are essential to the success of a software project, you should verify that your mental model of the use case matches the stakeholderâ€™s mental model. You also can verify a use case by creating a view of your mental model that illustrates the behavior of that use case. To do that you can actually model the flow of events of the Use Case in an Activity diagram and validate the Use Case by reviewing the Activity diagram with stakeholders. Again, Activity diagrams can also be used for modeling business processes and modeling detailed design.**
