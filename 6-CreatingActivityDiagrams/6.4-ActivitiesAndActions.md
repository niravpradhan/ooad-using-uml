**Let us look at Activities and Actions. Well activities and actions are processes taken by the system or an actor. So activity nodes and action nodes use the same notion or notation rather in UML. An activity can be divided into other activities or actions. An action is an activity node, which cannot be divided within the context of the current view. And a primitive form of action results in a change in the state of the system or the return of a value.**
