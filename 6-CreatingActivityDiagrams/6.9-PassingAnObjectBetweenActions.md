**Looking now at Passing an Object between Actions. Well an activity diagram can show objects being passed between actions. So a pin in a connection point to an action for object input or output and the name of the pin denotes the object being passed in or out. So a pin is shown as using a small rectangle attached above or below the activity node like we see on the current figure. You can optionally show the state of the object that is being passed within square brackets next to the object name.**
