**Now let us go ahead and look at creating the tiers and layer package diagram. So the tiers and layers package diagram provides a matrix of package icons that list the technologies required for every combination of tier and layer. So we can actually create this diagram by again following the steps that we see on the slide. First we determine one application component exist, then we determine what technology APIs communication protocols or specifications are required that the components require. We determine which container products to use. Step 4, we determine which operating system to use and step 5, we determine what hardware to use.**
