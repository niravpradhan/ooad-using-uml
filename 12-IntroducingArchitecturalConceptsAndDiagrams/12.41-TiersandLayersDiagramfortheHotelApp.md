**And the next slide actually shows us the tiers and layer diagram for the hotel application, but in this case having the client to be a standalone client. So we see for all the hardware, we have the hardware platform for the client, we have NEPC for the hotel reservation system we have an Athlon server. Lower platform we have NEOS, for the hotel application we have the Red Hat LINUX, for the Apple platform and again we have any Java SE on the client side and on the server side, on the business tier we have the Java SE, on the integration tier we have the PostDriver and on the resource tier, we have the PostgreSQL. For the virtual platform, again on the client side because it is a standalone client, we have the Swing API. For the business tier we have the RMI, for the integration tier we have the JDBC, and for the resource tier, we have the SQL DDL and for the application platform on the client side, we have just the hotel application interface and on the business tier we have the hotel reservation business application and business logic. In the integration tier we have a bunch of DAOs data access objects and for resource tier we have the DBMS or the database schema.**
