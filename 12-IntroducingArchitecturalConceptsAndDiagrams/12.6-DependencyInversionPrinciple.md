# 12.6 - Dependency Inversion Principle

**So looking at the Dependency Inversion Principle, we see pretty much that it depend upon abstractions and we should not depend on concretions, and we mentioned this in one of the previous modules. So a client component that depends on an interface makes the software more flexible because the supplier component can be changed or replaced without affecting the client component. Again this principle is illustrated on this figure that we see on the current slide where we have a client that makes use of a component, again the client depends on the class and in this case we are making use of a client that depends on a particular object of that particular class, in this case for example a supplier. We can also make the client depend on the interface. So in this case, the client actually makes use of an interface which is implemented by one of the suppliers that we want to use.**
