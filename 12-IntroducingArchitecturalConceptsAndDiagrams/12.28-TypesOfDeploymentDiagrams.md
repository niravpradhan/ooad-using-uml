**Now looking at types of deployment diagrams, well there are two forms, again in this particular case. First one is a descriptor deployment diagram that shows the fundamental hardware configuration. Again this is a conceptual diagram, the hardware nodes in these form are meant to be thought of as typical pieces of hardware, and of course the second form would be an instance deployment diagram that shows the hardware configuration and includes specific hardware decisions, and in this case, the form represents an actual or planned hardware topology and we see an example here of an instance hardware node which is a system and we see the speed the memory, the CPU, and the OS and so forth, and of course the web server representing these particular web application in this case which is the www.dayview. whatever comments so forth.**
