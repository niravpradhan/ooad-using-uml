# 12.7 - Architectural Patterns and Design Patterns

**Now looking at architecture patterns and design patterns. Well the patterns are standard solutions to commonly recurring problems in a particular context. Again by using a pattern-based reasoning process to plan systems, the architect can actually analyze systems to identify problems and trade offs with respect to service level requirements. So each of these problems might be solved by applying a particular pattern or it might again require further analysis and decomposition. So the architect can then synthesize the system by combining the pattern solutions into aggregate constructs. So an architect typically must be familiar with a variety of pattern catalogs to be effective. Again the types of patterns that we have typically we have the design patterns that define a structure and behavior to construct effective and reusable object-oriented software components to support the function requirements, and the architecture patterns on the other hand, they define structure and behavior for systems and sub-systems to support nonfunctional requirements.**
