**Looking at the types of components, well a component again in this case is any physical software unit. So on this figure it shows a genetic component again it could be a regular component, there are component with interface, could be a database, could be a source, a JAVA file, it could be a JAR file which is made of classes, could be a servelet which is a web component or it could be a whole application.
