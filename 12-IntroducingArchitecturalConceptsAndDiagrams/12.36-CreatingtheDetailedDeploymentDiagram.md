**Now looking at creating the detailed deployment diagram, well the detailed deployment diagram is pretty much shows us the actual components that need to be developed. So the detailed deployment diagram acts as the basis for the architecture template which again the development team will use to complete the constructions of four of the system after the architecture team has built the architecture baseline. So to create the detailed deployment diagram, we first need to design the components for the architecturally significant use cases. Again this step requires the architect to design the boundary service and entity components that support every architecturally significant use case, then we place the design components into the architecture model. Again the design components are then placed within an infrastructure that supports the high-level architecture, and then draw the detailed deployment diagram from the merger of the design and infrastructure components. So again the merger of the design components with infrastructure is then again drawn using the detailed deployment diagram.**
