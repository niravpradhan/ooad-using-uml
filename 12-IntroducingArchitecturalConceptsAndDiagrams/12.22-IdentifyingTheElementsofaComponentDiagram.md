**Lets us look at identifying the elements of a component diagram. Well a component diagram is a diagram that shows the organizations and dependencies among components. Again a UML component diagram is composed of the following elements which we see on this current slide. We have the component element, we have the dependency, like for example a reservation user form user interface depends on the reservation service and we have the interface. So in this particular case, reservation form user interface will make use of the reservation service interface which forwards the method to the reservation service implementation. Now let us look at the notation for required interfaces in UML 2. So the figure that we see on this slide shows the notation for a required interface in UML 2. Again which is particularly useful when the component with the required interface is shown in a separate diagram. So in this example, we see again a UML 2 style required interface in this particular case and we see it how we have the required interface which is a reservation service and of course the reservation service which is provided as an interface. The next slide shows us again a UML 2 style component notation that may be used instead of the previous style that we have seen in the previous slide. So in this example, we have a UML 2 style component notation where in this case, we have the component icon in every single component that we see here like a reservation user interface, form interface, reservation service property and room.**
