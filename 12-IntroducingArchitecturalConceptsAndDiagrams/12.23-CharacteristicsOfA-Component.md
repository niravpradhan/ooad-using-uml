**Let us look at the characteristics of a component. Well, we can use a UML component diagram in a wide variety of ways. Again a few characteristics of components and component diagrams are, a component represents any software unit. Again a component can be any type of software including non-executable software. A component can be a large in abstract, again a component can be a complete system or a subsystem. A component can be small, in this case, for example could be a single object. A component might have an interface that it expose and exports as a service to other components, and in this case an interface can be a conceptual or concrete and an interface or an abstract interface might be the communication protocol used by a large component. For example, a Structured Query Language can be considered to the interface to communicate to a Database Management System or it could be a component that can be a file such as a source file, a source code file, an object file, a complete executable, a data file, an HTML or media file and so on.**
