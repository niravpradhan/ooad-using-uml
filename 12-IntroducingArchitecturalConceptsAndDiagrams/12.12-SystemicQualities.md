**Now looking at the systemic qualities, well the strategies, tools and practices that will deliver the requisite quality of service across the tiers and layers, so that is typically what the systemic qualities are. And again looking at the SunTone Architecture Methodology it suggests again the categorization of the systemic qualities into four main groups. First one is the manifest that addresses the qualities reflected in the end user experience of the system. The operational address is the qualities reflected in the execution of the system, example of operation qualities include throughput security serviceability and so on, the developmental addresses the qualities reflected in the planning cost and physical implementation of the system. Again an example of development qualities include realization of the system planning of the system and of course determining in terms of planability, we should be able to have a measure of confidence on the predictability of determining cost estimates and planning those estimates, an evolutionary group addresses the qualities reflected in the long-term ownership of the system. Example of evolutionary qualities include scalability, extensibility, flexibility and so forth. So architecture is a process of selecting trade offs. Again some systemic qualities will be more important than others. So the architect must make the appropriate decisions that determine which systemic qualities to focus on.**
