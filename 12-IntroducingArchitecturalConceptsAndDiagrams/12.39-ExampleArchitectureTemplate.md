**In the next slide, we actually see an example of architecture template. So we see how the servelets become a boundary, the HTML pages or JSPs became boundary, the stub became service, the Java bean became an entity in the customer Java bean. The service implementation becomes a service, the data access object became an entity and the user interface frame which is the reservation frame user interface actually or the reservation form is an interface became a boundary.**
