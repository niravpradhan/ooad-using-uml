**Now let us look again the next slide and in this next slide, we actually have the tiers and layers diagram for the hotel system, but in this case we have a web presence. So in this case we are making use of a thin client that makes use of a browser, which accesses a presentation tier and the presentation tier accesses the business tier. So for the hardware platform again on the client tier we have NEPC, on the presentation tier which is the web container or in this case we have an Athlon system and for the business tier, we have an Athlon server, again this Athlon server is big enough to actually host the business tier, the integration tier and the resource tier in this case which is the database. In terms of the lower platform on the client tier NEOS, again it is a thin client on the presentation tier which is the web container we have a LINUX and on the business integration and resource tier we have again Red Hat LINUX. On the upper platform, we have any browser for the thin client, a presentation tier we have the Tom Cat, again that sits on the Java SE JVM and then for the business tier we have the Java SE. For the integration tier we have the PostDriver and for the resource tier we have the PostgreSQL. In terms of virtual platform for the thin client, we have HTML, for the presentation tier we have servelets and JSPs, business tier we have RMI, integration we have JDBC and resource we have SQL DDL and for the application platform for the client we have the client user interface which is again a user interface represented by the browser, a page. For the presentation tier, we have the web presentation application, which is again implemented using servelets and JSPs and for the business tier we have the hotel reservation business logic which again is implemented in Java. Again for the integration tier, we have a bunch of data access objects and for the resource tier we have the database schema.**
