**Now looking at the web-centric and we see a lot of examples that exist in the market making use of the web-centric application which is again n-tier. So the web-centric application provides access to the application through a web browser on the client workstation. Again the fact that we are using a web browser is attractive. So because it is a thin client, so we can use this architecture type to bring again our business to the Internet. Again the diagram that we see on this current slide illustrates this architecture type. So there is one major drawback of this architecture. If users within your company need to use the application, they must use the web application. Again this is a security risk because you are making internal business functions accessible to the Internet. So that is why sometimes it is not actually a good idea to host all your business logic on your web server.**
