# 12.8 - Tiers, Layers, and Systemic Qualities

**So now looking at tiers, layers and systemic qualities. Well the SunTone architecture methodology recommends again the following architectural dimensions. Before actually stating this architectural dimensions, I should mention that the SunTone stands for Sun technology open network environment architecture methodology. Now again the architecture dimensions that the SunTone architecture methodology recommends are the tiers to separate the logical concerns of the application. So in a sense that we are making use of the tiers, so that we can separate the logical concerns of the application. The layer tier or the layers is, they are used typically to organize the component and container relationships, and the systemic qualities identify strategies and patterns across the tiers and layers. So in a sense, we have the tiers that somehow separate the logical concerns from the web tier to the business tier to the integration tier. On the other hand the layers, they are used to organize the component and container relationship, and again when we look at the layers, we will see how we pretty much separate the hardware platform from the lower platform, from the upper platform to the virtual platform, and the application platform.**
