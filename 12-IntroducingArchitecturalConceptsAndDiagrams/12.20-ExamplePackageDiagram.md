**Now the next slide here shows us an example of a package diagram. So for this example, we actually can group our user interface component into a user interface package, in this case the main user interface or the reservation form user interface are actually inside the same package called the user interface package and then the services package contains the reservation service interface, contains the reservation service implementation and the reservation service stub which is the interface in this particular case, and of course the domain package contains the two Java beans, the room JavaBean and the property JavaBean and we see how these packages can actually use a Java.**
