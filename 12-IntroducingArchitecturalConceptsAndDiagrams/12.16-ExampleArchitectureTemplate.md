# 12.16 - Example Architecture Template

**Let us go ahead and look at an example of architecture template. So on this diagram that we see on this particular slide, we can actually look at it as an architecture template created by the architect. So again this template provides a view of the set of physical components that implement the design components. So the template consists of the types of components that will implement every type of design components. So in this case could be boundary service and of course could be an entity. So the template also shows the communication dependency which is represented by best rows, and the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates the example of an architecture template. So we see how on the intra-network station we have user interface frame which is a boundary that makes use of a services stub and again that service stub will go ahead and do an RMI call on the service skeleton which itself forwards the method to the service implementation and the service implementation most probably will create a JavaBean that represents an entity. Again that JavaBean is serializable and a copy of it actually moves from the application server to the intra-network station and most probably that entity JavaBean contains a bunch of information or data that the boundary is going to use to again view that information, so that the booking agent can actually look at it.**
