**And this actually all these three dimensions are often represented graphically using the 3D cube diagrams. Lots of times it is called the SunCube which represents the SunTone architecture methodology 3D cube diagram, where we see the layers that are represented by the hardware platform, the lower platform which is typically an app-server for example rather the OS system that runs the hardware like Solaris OS system or Windows OS system and so forth or LINUX OS system and then we have the upper platform which is the application server, for example like a web logic application server, the Oracle web logic application serve, or the Oracle glassfish application server. The virtual platform representing the different specifications and frameworks used by the particular application server and the application that we typically implement. The tiers as we see on the cube they are represented by the client presentation, client tier, presentation tier, business tier integration tier and resources tier, and for the systemic qualities, we see the qualities that are manifested, the operational qualities, the developmental qualities, and the evolutionary qualities.**
