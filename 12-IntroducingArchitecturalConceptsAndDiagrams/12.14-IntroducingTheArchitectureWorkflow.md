**Moving along and let us go ahead now and introduce the architecture workflow. Well the steps to actually that represent the architectural workflow would be first we select an architecture type for the system. Again an architect selects the architectural type that best satisfies the high level constraints and non-functional requirement. So an architectural type refers to a small set of abstract architectures such as standalone or may be the client server or may be application centric n-tier or may be web centric n-tier or may be an enterprise n-tier type of architecture. Step 2, we create a detailed deployment diagram for the architecturally significant use cases. Step 3, we refine the architecture model to satisfy the non-functional requirements. Step 4, again we test the architecture baseline. Again the architecture or particularly the architect implements the architecturally significant use cases in an evolutionary prototype. So when all architecturally significant use cases have been developed, the evolutionary prototype is called the architecture baseline. So the architecture baseline pretty much represents the version of the system solution that manages all risks. So the architecture baseline is the final product of the elaboration phase and becomes the starting point to the construction phase. Well next, we pretty much look at documenting the technology choices in tiers and layers package diagram. Again in this case for every tier and every layer, the architect identifies the appropriate technologies to be used in that tier and layer, and the next step would be to create an architecture template from the final detailed deployment diagram. Again the architecture template is an abstract version of the detailed deployment diagram in which the design components are identified within the structure of the architecture and again of course infrastructure components. So we can use this template to guide the development team during the construction phase.**
