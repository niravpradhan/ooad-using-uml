**After looking at introducing architectural concepts and diagrams where we looked at justifying the need for the architectural. We looked at distinguishing between architecture and design. We looked at tiers, layers and systemic qualities. We looked at exploring the architecture workflow. We looked at describing key architecture diagrams, we looked at selecting the architecture type. And we looked at creating the architecture workflow artifacts. Let's go ahead and look at the example that illustrates some of the features that we learned and particularly we want to be able to actually create a high level deployment diagram that is related to the hotel system use case that we have been working with throughout this course. Well, looking out the current slide that we see, we can see that in the middle we have an Application Server Machine that hosts the hotel application software. And we see that these Application Server Machine or the application which is the Hotel Application Software interacts with many different applications or devices around it. And let's start with the customers machine which is a browser as we see on this current slide, the browser interacts with the Web server, again, interacting with the Web server components. And of course the Web server which represents the Web interface machine interacts with the Application Server Machine. Again, the interaction is through RMI. We also see how the Travel Agent System interacts with the Application Server Machine through the Web services and again over making use of SOAP messages. We also see how the Hotel Staff Machine which contains the Hotel Interface Software that a booking agent uses interacts with the Hotel Application Software through RMI. We also see how the Hotel Application Software interacts with the Electronic Payment Machine through SOAP through Web services. We also see how this Hotel Application Software interacts with the external loyalty points as key machine in this case through Web services. And we see how again the Hotel Application Software interacts with the database server hardware in this case with the database through the TCP IP connection which pretty much making use of SQL. The SQL dialect of that particular database that we use, for example Oracle database. And we also see how the hotel application software again interacts with the department display screens again through Web services. And we see also how the Hotel Application Software interacts with the hotel telephone exchange and thatâ€™s again through the Web services. And of course, we see how the Hotel Application Software interacts with the handheld device. And in this case through again Web services, so this actually slide gives us a very, very nice picture on the high-level deployment diagram of the hotel system case that we have been looking at and using throughout this course.**
