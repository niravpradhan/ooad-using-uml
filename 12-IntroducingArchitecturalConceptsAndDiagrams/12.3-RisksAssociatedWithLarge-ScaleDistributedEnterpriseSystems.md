**Looking at risks associated with large scale distributed enterprise systems. Well as systems move from a single host to large scale distributed enterprise systems, the risks and difficulty of meeting project requirements of course increases. Well looking at minimally distributed systems, these are typically a system that runs entirely on a single host, all pieces of the system communicate with each other reasonably quickly and at appropriately the same speed. Even when the system becomes a client server system, which we see on this slide, the communication is reasonably very easy to control. Again this situation is the premise of the same computer near the data, again validate near the user. In this particular case, we have clients and they have all the business logic and they access the server which pretty much access the database to access the database. Now the next one is the highly distributed systems. So in the more distributed systems making the right choices about where components are located and how they communicate becomes much more critical and difficult. So the importance of these decisions created the need for architects and if we take a look at the diagram that we see on this slide which represents the highly distributed systems we see that the critical role of the architect is to perform high level planning for the location of and the communication among software components. Again this role distinguishes the architect from the designer, programmer, integrator, and a bunch of other different roles. So we see here, we have different tiers and we have clients that access the system through a firewall and we have internal clients and of course the different tiers make use of some services, could be security services for example that has its own database like an LDAP system, but also we have an integration tier that acts as your database like an Oracle database and by the way your system can also access other servers through different firewalls.**
