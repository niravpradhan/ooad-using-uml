**And that lead us to the enterprise n-tier architecture. For the enterprise applications, again this actually provides a hybrid web-centric and application-centric architecture. So in this case, the architecture in this particular architecture type a web application is provided for the Internet public as well as thin client applications for companyâ€™s Internet users. Again the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates that architecture type. These architecture again provides the greatest flexibility by separating every logic tier into a separate machine, so the data integrity and security problems with the web-centric architecture are resolved by having access to a remote business service. So in a sense now all the business logic now sits now in the application server. So in a sense that when the client accesses the web server, all what the web server is doing over there is just forwarding the request to the application server for the business logic and of course once data comes back from the application server, the web server uses the different pages in this case could be HTML pages or JSP pages or JSF pages to represent the data in a form of an HTML response back to the web browser clients. Again continuing with the enterprise n-tier architecture, so there are two thin clients that we can use. We can a web browser for Internet users and we can use Graphical User Interface thin client for Intranet users, for example internal users. And web application servers provide presentation logic and application servers provide business logics like we discussed earlier.**
