**Now looking at tiers, well tiers are a logical or a physical organization of components into an order chain of service providers and consumers. So we see as we saw on the SunCube we have the client or the SunTone cube we have the client tier that consist of a thin client such as a web browser, presentation tier provides the HTML pages and forms that are sent to the web browser and processes the users request, we typically have the web components over there. Business tier provides the business services and entities, integration provides components to integrate the business tier with the resource tier and the resource tier itself contains all the backhand resources such as database management or Enterprise Information System like a mainframe and so forth.**
