**Now distinguishing between architecture and design, well looking at this particular table, it actually gives us a very nice idea on what should an architect do and what should a designer do. So it pretty much shows us how architects differ from designers. Well this table shows us different again levels, we have the abstraction level, we have deliverables and we have the area of focus. So for the abstraction level, the architects have tendency to focus on the high broad focus on a few details, and the designer on the other hand focus on the low specific and the focus on many details. In terms of deliverables, for the architect we have the system and subsystem plans, architecture prototypes of course which are the blueprints, on the other hand for the designer we have the component designs, code and specification. In terms of the area of focus, the architect have tendency to focus on the non-functional requirements, risks management, on the other hand, the designers they focus on the functional requirements which is what the system is supposed to do for the user.**
