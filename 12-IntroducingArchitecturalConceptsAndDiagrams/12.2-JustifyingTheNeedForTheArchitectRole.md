# 12.2 - Justifying the Need for the Architect Role

**Now, looking at justifying the need for architecture role. Well for years software has been developed without a special role called architect. Again why is that software engineering groups are now employing people in this particular role. Well in recent years, two crucial changes have actually occurred in the software engineering. The first and most obvious is the one of scale. Well scale for example how many users has been increasing since the first computer program was written. Again in the web applications, the scale of systems is critical issue because you can never know exactly how many users will be requesting services, the second change which has been again much more sudden is the distribution of software components across multiple servers. Again for example, web applications are distributed by nature. So the huge increases in load that are typical of internet deployed systems tend to make multiple parallel server necessary and of course this further increases distribution. So why is distribution a reason to create a new role in software engineering and why is it appropriate to call this role architect. Well the answer to this question is the focus of this particular module.**
