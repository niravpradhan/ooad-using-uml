**And we see this in this particular slide, we actually see the detailed deployment diagram, where in this case we can have the client tier that actually accesses which is represented by a browser and accesses the presentation tier which is represented by the web server through an HTTP call and again on the web server we have the servelet in this case which is the reservation controller and that servelet itself actually can make use of either JSPs represented by select room or it could be JSPs or HTML pages also that reservation controller on the web tier which is a servelet actually in this particular case calls the reservation servelets through each stub, and it is stub in this case is actually represented by the reservation service implementation stub. And we make use of the JRMP which is Java Remote Method Protocol to actually access the reservation service implementation which sits in the business tier. Again this when we implement the reservation service implementation we also implement the interface which is a reservation represented by the reservation implementation stub and then we actually publish that in to an RMI register. And of course the servelet will actually do a lookup for that service reservation implementation stub. Then when it gets that reservation or the reference to that stub then you will go ahead and invoke a method which you actually forwarded through RMI to the reservation service implementation. Well the reservation service implementation can actually make use of a data access object, in this case the customer data access object actually to access the database to get information about the customer. Again once that information is again selected from the database, then in that case, we can go ahead and put it into a Java bean called customer and that Java bean, which is again a customer is serializable and a copy of it can actually move back to the web tier. Again that Java bean or customer Java bean represents the information of the customer and of course the JSPs or HTML pages make use of that information in the customer Java bean to actually represent all that information in the form of a page and sent back to the browser so that the customer can see the information about that particular I mean about the reservation that belongs to a customer and so forth. We also can have an internal client in this case a booking agent, that makes use of an intra network station which makes use of some boundary components like in his case a reservation form user interface which may be is built using AWT or a Swing API and again it makes use of the stub to actually call the reservation implementation through RMI or JRMP. Again and of course the reservation service implementation access the database through the customer data access object, get the information related to the customer and sends it back in the form of a Java bean which is serializable and of course the reservation form is an interface makes use of the information inside that Java bean to represent all that information in this user interface frame and shows it to the booking agent.**
