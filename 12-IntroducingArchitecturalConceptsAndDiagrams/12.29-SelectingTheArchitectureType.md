**Selecting the architecture type, well selecting the architecture type for a system provides the development team a vision of the top level software and hardware structure of the system. Again this is recorded in a high-level deployment diagram. And the architecture to use depends on many factors including the platform constraints in the system requirements. Again very often the system requirement specification will specify the platform, for example operating system, application platform, hardware and so on. The modes of user interaction, again how a given actor will use the system might constrain the architecture, and the persistence mechanism. Again the type of persistence storage will guide architecture decisions, and the data and transactional integrity that pretty much similarly again data and transactional integrity will guide architecture decisions. Of course there are hundreds of successful software architectures. A few common types are typically the standalone applications. Again since there are so many successful software architectures, here are some few common types that we see on this and they are actually listed on this current slide, standalone applications, client server which is the 2-tier applications, the n-tier applications, the web-centric n-tier applications and the enterprise n-tier applications.**
