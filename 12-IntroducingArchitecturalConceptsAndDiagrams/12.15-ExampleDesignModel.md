**Now let us go ahead and look at a design model, particularly an example of a design model. So during the architecture workflow, the architect performs the job of the software designer by creating design models of the architecturally significant use cases. So we should remember that not all models require artifacts. Again therefore the architect might not create a drawing of the design model, but the architect definitely has a mental model of the design of the use cases. Again the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates an example of a design model, where in this case we make use of boundary components, service components and entity components.**
