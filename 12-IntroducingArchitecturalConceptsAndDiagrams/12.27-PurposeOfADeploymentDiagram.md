**Now let us look at the purpose of a deployment diagram. What a deployment diagram again usually contains the following elements, the hardware nodes that can represent any type of physical hardware. Again hardware node is usually a computer that it can also be any physical device that communicates with a computer network. The links between hardware nodes indicate connectivity and can include the communication protocol used between the nodes. Again a deployment diagram represents a graph of links that show the topology of real computer network. Again these links are shown as solid lines with no rows and there is usually a stereotype label on the link that specifies the communication protocol used between the nodes, and of course the software components that are placed within hardware nodes to show the distribution of the software across the network. Again a deployment diagram can show how to deploy software components onto the hardware nodes of the system solution.**
