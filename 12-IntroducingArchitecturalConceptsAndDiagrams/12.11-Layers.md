**Now looking at the layers, well for the layers, the hardware and software stack that host services within a given tier. Again the layers represent component container relationship. Again we can actually look at it and we have already seen that on the SunTone architecture methodology. For the different layers that we actually see are the application that provides a concrete implementation of components to satisfy your functional requirements, your business logic, your which should provide a platform which provides the APIs and specifications that the application components implement and the user platform or rather the upper platform consist of products such as a web and an EJB technology containers and a middleware like we mentioned, the middleware could be for the upper platform or web logic application server or the glassfish application server. The lower platform consist of the operating system which could Solaris for example OS system, LINUX or Windows OS systems and the hardware platform includes again computing the hardware such as servers storage and network devices.**
