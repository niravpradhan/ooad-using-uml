**So here is an example that actually represents the hotel reservation system architecture where we are actually making use of the enterprise n-tier architecture. So we have the clients that do have what browsers that connect to web server and the web server connects to the application server where the hotel reservation business logic lives and of course because the machine is big enough you can actually host the database on that particular machine too, and we can also have a client workstations for booking agents in this case, the internal users that can access directly through their workstations, they can access their application server, which in this case is the hotel reservation system business application.**
