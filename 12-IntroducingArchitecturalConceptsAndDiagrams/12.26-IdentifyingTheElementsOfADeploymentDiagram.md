**Let us look at identifying the elements of a deployment diagram. So a deployment diagram is a diagram that shows the configuration of runtime processing nodes and the components processes and objects that live on them. So a deployment diagram represents a physical hardware pieces of a system. The distribution of software components within every hardware mode and the dependencies between the software components. Again, the figure that we see on this particular slide shows or illustrates an example of deployment diagram, in this case we see how we have a customer computer that has a browser and we have a mobile phone again it could belong to a car or rental booking application and so forth and we have a travel agent system. All of those actually access a car rental service system again you know that car rental server has a web server, it has again a car rental application and it has a database, and of course that car rental server itself can actually interact with an Electronic Payment System. And again the communication as we see it is either TCP over Internet, HTTP or HTTPS TCP over Internet and so forth and it could be by the way it could be a web service call too where we see actually SOAP messages.**
