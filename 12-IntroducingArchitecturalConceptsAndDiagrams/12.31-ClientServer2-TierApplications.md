# 12.31 - Client/Server (2-Tier) Applications

**The next one is the client server 2-tier application, where in this particular case, we actually see how in this case we have a client workstation representing the users and then we have the database server which pretty much represents the server on where the database lives. Again the two subtypes of client server application is the thin client and the thick client. So the thin client refers to a user interface that does not contain any business logic on the other hand the thick client prefers the user interface that provides business logic on the client tier. Again thick clients have the tendency to be very difficult to manage and of course it is also difficult to scale and that is why typically we like the thin client type of architecture simply because we want all the business logic to live on the server side rather than on the client side.**
