# 12.13 - Exploring the Architecture Workflow

**Let us go ahead and explore the architecture workflow. Well the architecture workflow analyses the nonfunctional requirements of the requirements model to determine the structure of the infrastructure components in the proposed system. Of course the design workflow analyzes the functional requirements of the requirements model to determine the structure of the designed components. Of course, we know that when we take the architecture model and the design model and merge them together, we actually provide the first draft of a solution model. Again it is the solution model for which the software programmers can actually create code, and we see this on the diagram that we see on this or the figure that we see on this particular slide.**
