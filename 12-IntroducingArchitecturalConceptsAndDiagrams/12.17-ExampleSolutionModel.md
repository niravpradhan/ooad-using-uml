# 12.17 - Example Solution Model

**Here is an example of a solution model. So a solution model is formed by snapping in design components into the architecture template. So this model forms the basis of the architecture or particularly the actual implementation. Again the figure that we see on the slide illustrates an example of a solution model, where in this case we see a user interface frame called the main user interface and from it we can actually now click on a button that will get us to the user interface frame called reservation form user interface and which again makes a call on the reservation service stub and of course that reservation service stub will communicate with the reservation skeleton on the other side on the application server through RMI, Remote Method Implication, and that reservation service skeleton will forward the method to the reservation implementation. Again the reservation implementation contains a bunch of business methods that will help us create a property JavaBean and a room JavaBean and again the property bean contains the information about the property and the room bean contains information about the room. Again those two Java beans are serializable and that is why a copy of those two Java beans are actually transferred back to the intra-network station. Again the reservation form is an interface, makes use of the information in the property bean and the information in the room bean to display all that information to the booking agent.**
