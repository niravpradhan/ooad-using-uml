**Now looking at the n-tier applications, for the n-tier applications it actually exist across multiple machines, so there are three fundamental variations of the n-tier applications. We have the application-centric, the web-centric and the enterprise-centric. For the application-centric, the partitions pretty much the business components onto a separate application server, the client workstations host a thin client application that uses the services of the application server. Again we can see this on the figure that we see on the current slide that illustrates that, where we have client workstations that connect to the application server, in this case that has the remote business application and of course that application server interacts with a database server.**
