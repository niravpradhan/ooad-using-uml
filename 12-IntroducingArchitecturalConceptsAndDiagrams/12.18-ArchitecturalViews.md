**Moving along and let us look now at the architectural views. Well again looking at the architectural views, we can say that the views of the architecture model take many forms. Some elements such as risk mitigation plans are documented with text, others can be recorded using UML diagrams. Again those UML diagrams that we can use to recall them are the package diagram, component diagram and deployment diagram. Again these diagrams are actually discussed in the next few slides.**
