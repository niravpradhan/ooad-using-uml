**Let us look at identifying the elements of a package diagram. Well a package diagram is a general purpose mechanism for organizing elements into groups. Again packages maybe nested within other packages. So a UML package diagram shows dependencies between packages. A package is a UML icon that groups other kinds of UML element diagram and of course or additional packages, and we see on the figure that we have on this particular slide, it actually shows us two graphical forms for a package. We can actually have the package where the name of the package is in the middle of the big rectangle of the package or we can see it with a name on the top of the package. Of course the package name that we set can be placed inside the body of the box or in the name box that we see on the top of the body box that we see in this particular slide. Of course, we can place any UML entity in a package including other packages like I mentioned. And as a note, a UML package is not the same as a Java technology package. However we can use a UML package to represent a Java technology package.**
