**Let us look at an example of component diagrams. Again the most common use for a component diagram is to show the dependencies or collaborations. Again between various software components, so the figure that we see on this slide shows an example of such a component diagram in this case we have a reservation form user interface that again connects through RMI to a reservation service, a stub but again that itself can now actually talk to or depends on the property component and the room component. So here is another example of component diagrams where in this case the component diagrams can show software dependency. Again this example shows a web service dependency, in our case here travel agent systems makes use of a web service call through SOAP on the reservation web service which itself can actually consume that SOAP message and cause the different reservation web service which themselves can actually make use of components like other java beans, in this case property JavaBean and a room JavaBean and so forth. Here is another example of component diagrams and in this particular case we can actually see how component diagrams can represent building structures. So for this particular example, we see a domain.jar file which is built from the class files for the customer and reservation classes and again those classes actually we got from the compilation of the customer.java file and the reservation.java file. Again all of those are bundled and jarred into a JAR file called domain.jar. So in this particular case the customer.class and reservation.class are jarred in the jar file that is called domain.jar and of course the customer.class and reservation.class, they actually were created by compiling the customer.java and the reservation.java files.**
