**Now, let's go ahead and look at the problem for the strategy pattern. Well, the strategy pattern solves the problem having again these characteristics where you have a set of classes that are only different in the algorithms that they use, of course you want to change algorithms at runtime. So for solution of this particular strategy pattern we have again a solution that has the following characteristics where you create an interface, a Strategy that is implemented by a set of concrete algorithm classes and of course, at runtime we can actually select an instance of these concrete classes within the Context class.**
