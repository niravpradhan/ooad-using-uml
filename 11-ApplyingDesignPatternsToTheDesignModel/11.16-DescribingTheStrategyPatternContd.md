**Of course, this strategy pattern has also a bunch of consequences. So the consequences of the strategy pattern include an alternate to subclassing, so that is good so this strategy actually is an alternative to subclassing, also so instead of using subclassing on inheritance we just make use of this strategy which is quite attractive, so the strategy pattern eliminates the need to subclass to support multiple algorithms. And also, it includes strategies eliminate actually condition a statements, so some programmers might consolidate multiple algorithms into a single algorithm and use a condition of statements to branch between the differences in every algorithm. Again this solution leads to a complex code that is hard to maintain, so the strategy pattern eliminates condition of statements by putting every algorithm in its own class and that is actually very attractive. Also, it has an advantage of the choice of implementations. So again using the strategy pattern the context object can change the algorithm at runtime, so this solution increases the flexibility of software in general. Well, one of the strategies that actually we can incur or the consequences rather that we have from this strategy pattern is that communication overhead between strategy and context patterns. So on the downside the strategy pattern introduces this additional communication overhead between the Strategy objects and the Context object. This again could lead to complicated code if a given strategy requires private details of the context. And, of course, another problem we have is that it increases number of objects. So using this strategy pattern it actually introduces the need for additional objects at runtime. Again these are the strategy objects at runtime, however these objects might not require any attributes of their own. Therefore, you could use a single instance of each concrete strategy class that all contexts share.**
