# 11.23 - Describing the Abstract Factory Pattern

**Let us go ahead and look now at describing the abstract factory pattern. Well, the abstract factory pattern provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. So the Java technology is based on using the Java Virtual Machine to provide platform independence. So creating platform independent Graphical User Interface was particularly challenging. So the design of the AWT require the separation of the abstract user interface component such as the java.awt.Button from the actual operating system components that physically represented the Graphical User Interface component on the screen. So the real components are called peers of the abstract Graphical User Interface components. Of course, therefore there is a set of peers for the user interface components on the motive platform as well as a set of peers on the Microsoft window platform. So the abstract AWT component uses the AWT toolkit class to create the appropriate peer at runtime. So when the Java SE platform Software Developmental Kit SDK which again created for a specific platform, then the SDK includes a concrete subclass of a toolkit which provides the methods to generate the relevant peers for that platform, and the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates this design, where we see we have actually toolkits and we have the WindowsToolkit and we have the MotifToolkit, and from it we can actually create MotifButton or a MotifLabel and of course, from the WindowsToolkit, we can create a WindowsButton or a WindowsLabel.**
