# 11.27 - Coding an Object with Complex State

**So let us go ahead and look now at programming or coding a complex object. So in this particular case, we actually have a problem with the coding complex object and before again introducing the state pattern, we would like to understand why the pattern exists of course, in this particular case, we see objects with complex states often are very difficult to code. So, one approach is to use the attributes of the objects to determine the state of the object which performs the actions of the state. Again this can lead to a very complex and hard to maintain code because such code usually introduces significant complex conditional statements and we see on this current slide, the example of the heating ventilation and AC system where in this case based on the attributes that or the state of the attributes, we have actually this if else if else type of code that becomes quite complex and very very hard to maintain.**
