**Now, let us go ahead now and look at the again the diagram that we see on this current slide that illustrates the observer pattern. So it is pretty much a class diagram of the observer pattern example. So the user interface classes must implement the observer interface to perform the necessary changes to the user interface representation when the update method is invoked. So the DataModel class inherits from the observable abstract class which provides the methods to attach and detach observers. So in this particular case, we have attach and observer, detach and observer, and notify method. The DataModel again is responsible for invoking the notify method, whenever its data change, and we see this in this particular figure on this current slide, where we have the DataModel that inherits from the observable which is the abstract class and of course it has the attach detach and notify methods, and of course, we have the observer interface which is implemented by the PieChart user interface, the BarChart user interface, and Spreadsheet user interface. And again it has an update method and of course, when the observable notifies the observers then of course, they update automatically.**
