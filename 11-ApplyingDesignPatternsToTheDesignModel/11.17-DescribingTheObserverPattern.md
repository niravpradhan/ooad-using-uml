# 11.17 - Describing the Observer Pattern

**Let's describe now the observer pattern. Well, for the observer pattern, we define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when an object changes all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. We are looking at the diagram that we see on this slide we assume that we have a set of data, a collection of numbers that we want to visualize using several different techniques using for example a pie chart, a bar chart, and/or a row in a spreadsheet, and the diagram here illustrates this situation. So if we kept a copy of the data in every Graphical User Interface component, then our software would have to modify the data in each of these components when the data changed in the system. Again this type coupling between the user interface components and the data model is brittle. A couple or a change in the data model would actually require changes to each user interface component that must visualize that data.**
