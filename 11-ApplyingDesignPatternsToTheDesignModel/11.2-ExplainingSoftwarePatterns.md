**Well, let's go ahead and explain the software patterns. Well, every pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment again and then describes the core of the solution to that particular problem. Again in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over without or ever doing it the same way twice. So a software pattern is a description of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context. Again this is by the gang of four. Well, typically the discipline of software patterns formalizes these patterns by identifying four essential elements of the pattern or the software pattern. Typically, the pattern name which is the element that provide a convenient and memorable term for the pattern. The problem which is the again states the conditions under which the pattern applies, solution which states the structural and dynamic behavior of the components that make up the pattern and consequences which pretty much represent the results of the pattern as well as any trade offs incurred by applying the pattern.**
