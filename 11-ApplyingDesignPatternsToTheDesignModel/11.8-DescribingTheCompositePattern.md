**Now, let's go ahead and describe the composite pattern. Well, the composite pattern compose objects into a tree structures to represent part whole hierarchies. Again composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. So the composite pattern deals with a whole part hierarchies, for example a Graphical User Interface container is an example of a whole part hierarchy, the container holds one or more Graphical User Interface component, for example a screen might have a group of Graphical User Interface component to collect customer information, name, address, and so on. So the screen which in this case implemented by for example a frame class is the container and labels and text fields are the parts that make up the whole, so abstract window tool kit includes only W2 includes actually a class called container that enables the programmer to add and remove components to the container. So the frame class is a sub class of container and the figure that we see on this slide illustrates this hierarchy where in this case we have a component that component could be a button or label or it could be a container which actually aggregates or contain more other components.**
