# 11.22 - Describing the Observer Pattern (Contd.)

**Of course, every pattern has its own consequences. So let us look at the observer pattern consequences, well, the consequences of the observer pattern include the fact that the abstract coupling between the subject and the observer so the coupling between the subject object and the observer object is again abstract and that is actually is an advantage. So this coupling is abstract because the subject does not know the concrete class of every observer. It only knows that the observer object supports the observer interface, which is in this case the update method. It also supports for multicast communication. So observer objects can dynamically attach to an object to a subject and whenever the subject changes all attached observers are notified in a broadcast of update messages to every observer, and the issue that we have with the observer pattern is the unexpected updates. So a downside of this pattern like I mentioned is that the communication mechanism is coarse-grain. So observers might not care if one part of the data model is changed, but there is no mechanism for the subject to know which observer is interested in which data changes. So it is up to the observer to query the data model and decide if the changes need to be processed. So the Java technology actually uses the observer pattern in several different ways. In the AWT every Graphical User Interface can actually listen for user input events such as typing a character in a text component, selecting a menu item or clicking on a button. Again you can create and attach listener objects to Graphical User Interface components that observe various user events for that component. Again these listeners are observers in the observer pattern and the Graphical User Interface component is the subject.**
