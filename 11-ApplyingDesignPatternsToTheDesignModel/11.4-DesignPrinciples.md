**Now, looking at design principles well there are several design principle that support the solutions of software patterns and the ones that we typically are interested by in this particular module are the Open Closed Principle (OCP), Composite Reuse Principle (CRP), and Dependency Inversion Principle which is again in this case we call it DIP. And of course, the again following the design principles typically it discusses every principle or every one of these principles using a common example. In this common example that we using here is the GUI Grid Container class which is a Graphical User Interface container that places every Graphical User Interface component element in a grid starting from the top left and adding components to the right and to the bottom. Again the figure that we see here on this particular slide shows this component and of course, a calculator example in this particular case.**
