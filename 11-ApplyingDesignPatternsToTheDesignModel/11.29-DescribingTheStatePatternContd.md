**So looking at the figure that we see on this particular slide, we see that every state class focuses only on the behavior of that state. For example, the CoolingState class includes an entry action of turning on the AC subsystem and exit action of turning the AC off and setRealTemp method that changes the state of the heating ventilation and AC object to idle if the temperature has dropped below the upper bound value, and we see this again all illustrated on the figure that we see on this slide.**
