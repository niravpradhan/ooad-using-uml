**So the state pattern problem actually has the following characteristics. An object's runtime behavior depends on its state, that is one characteristic and the other one is that operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the objects state. So the solution for the state pattern again has the following characteristics which are create an interface that supplies the state-based behavior of the object, create a concrete implementation of this interface for every state of the object, and dispatch the state based behaviors of the objects to the object's current state.**
