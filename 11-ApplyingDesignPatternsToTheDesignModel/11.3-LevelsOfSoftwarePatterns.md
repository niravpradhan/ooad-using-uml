# 11.3 - Levels of Software Patterns

**Now, looking at levels of software patterns. Well, large software systems can be visualized at many levels of depth, again similarly software patterns can be applied at any levels of depth, patterns can be roughly grouped into three different levels. One is the architecture pattern which typically manifest at the highest software and hardware structure and usually support non-functional requirements. So architecture patterns are usually always used at the highest software and hardware structure within the system. Design patterns again they typically manifest at the mid-level software structure within the system. Again these patterns apply to a small set of classes or components and they usually support functional requirements. Idioms on the other hand begin their patterns at the level that manifest at the lowest software structures, again classes and methods within the system. Again these patterns apply either within a class definition or even with the code of a method. For example, we can look at the concept of threads in Java and we can say that threads are idioms to Java as we all know that naturally Java supports multi-threading.**
