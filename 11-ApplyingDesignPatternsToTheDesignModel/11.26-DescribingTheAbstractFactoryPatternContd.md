**Now, let us go ahead and look at the consequences of the AbstractFactory pattern. Well, the consequences of the AbstractFactory pattern include the fact that it isolates concrete classes, so this pattern actually hides the concrete product classes, so the clients of these products must use the abstract class or interface, thus forcing the client into using the dependency version and of course, principle. And of course, in addition, it makes exchanging product families easy. So you can add and remove whole product families without changing the client code, because it depends on the abstract product classes, rather than on the concrete classes. And it promotes consistency among products, so when product objects in a family are designed to work together, it is important that an application use objects from only one family at a time. Again the AbstractFactory makes this easy to enforce. And of course, supporting a new kind of products is typically difficult. So on the downside changing a set of products is rather difficult because you have to update all of the product families that are currently used.**
