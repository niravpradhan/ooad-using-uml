**Again here in this slide, it shows us the solution for the observer pattern, which is described by the gang of four. So we see how we have the Subject which is an abstract class and we from it we extend the ConcreteSubject and of course, we see how we define the attach, detach, and notify methods and we have an Observer interface and the ConcreteObserver implements the observer interface by implementing the update method. So for all the observers, the do update will pretty much updates the or notify method typically notifies the observers and of course, the method the update method will get executed to update automatically based on the changes that happen in the subject or the observable.**
