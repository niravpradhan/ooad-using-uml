**So let's go ahead now and continue with the description of the composite pattern and now we are going to talk about the problem. Well, we actually want to represent the whole part hierarchy of the objects. That's the whole idea of the problem and we want to use the same interface on the assemblies and the components in an assembly. So as a solution we actually the solution of the composite pattern has again a bunch of characteristics and these are we create an abstract class, Component, that acts as the superclass for concrete leaf and Composite classes and the Composite class can be treated as a component because it supports the Component class interface.**
