**Now, let's look at the consequences of the composite pattern. Well, the consequences of the composite pattern include it actually makes the client simple, so the client of a composite part hierarchy does not need to care what type of components including a composite components it is dealing with. It can actually call any operation on the component object. It also makes it easier to add new kind of components, so you can add the new types of components and even new types of composites to the component hierarchy as long as the new class follows the same interface then the client classes do not have to be modified. But it can make the design model too general. What do you mean by that? Well, this pattern makes the component hierarchy very generic, so a composite can contain any type of components so there might be cases in which you want to restrict the types of components a given composite can hold. Again this is not possible with this particular pattern.**
