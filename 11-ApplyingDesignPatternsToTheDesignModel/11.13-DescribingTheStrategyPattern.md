# 11.13 - Describing the Strategy Pattern

**Let's go ahead now and describe the strategy pattern. Well, it typically define a family of algorithms encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable, again a strategy that lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. So looking at the Graphical User Interface containers in the AWT, it can be actually organized into several pre-defined layouts a grid, border, flow, and so on. So the AWT provides this mechanism by using a LayoutManager that is assigned to every Graphical User Interface containers so the container delegates the algorithm of laying out its components to this LayoutManager again this is a direct implementation of the strategy pattern and the diagram that we see on this particular slide actually illustrates this AWT strategy or in this particular case we have a component that makes use of a LayoutManager and of course that LayoutManager can be implemented by either a GridLayout, a BorderLayout or a FlowLayout.**
