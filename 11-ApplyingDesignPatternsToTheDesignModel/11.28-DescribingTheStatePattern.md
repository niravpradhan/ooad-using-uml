# 11.28 - Describing the State Pattern

**So the idea behind actually looking at or describing the state pattern, is that it allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Again the object will appear to change its classes. So the state pattern actually introduces a set of state objects within which the behavior of the primary object is encapsulated in the state class methods. So for the hotel, rather the heating ventilation and AC class, we would create four state classes which is the InitialState, IdleState, CoolingState, and HeatingState. Again every one of these classes implements a state interface that is specifically designed for the primary object. In this particular case every primary class has its own interface for its state objects and the primary class keeps a state attribute that holds the particular state object for the state of the primary object. So the primary class includes protected set state method, which performs the state transitions for the primary object. Again this method calls the exit action before changing state. Again in this case, it changes the state attribute and then calls the entry actions for the new state. So the state dependent methods of the primary class delegate the behavior to the current state object. So in the case of the heating ventilation and AC class, the setRealTemp method stores the new temperature value and then calls the corresponding method on the state object, and the figure that we see on this current slide illustrates the heating ventilation and AC class using the state pattern. So we have a state interface and this state interface has the three different abstract methods, doEntryAction, doExitAction, and setRealTemp method and then we have the classes InitialState, IdleState, CoolingState, and HeatingState that implement that particular interface.**
