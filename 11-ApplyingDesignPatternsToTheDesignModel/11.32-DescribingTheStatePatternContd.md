**Now, looking at the consequences of the state pattern. Well, the consequences of the state pattern include the fact that it localizes state specific behavior. So the state-specific behavior is localized to the class that models that particular state. Again this solution greatly simplifies the development of state objects, and the state pattern easily permits the addition of new state classes or the modification of the behavior of existing states without affecting the code in the other state classes. It also reduces conditional statements, so without using the state pattern, the methods of the primary class tend to use complex conditional code to keep track of the internal state of the object. Again the state pattern greatly reduces this type of conditional code and it makes the state transition explicit. So without using the state pattern, the methods of the primary class often hide the details of when the object transitions from one state to another. Again using the state pattern makes the state of the object and its state transitions explicit, but it increases the number of objects. So using the state pattern introduces the need for additional objects, state objects, of course, at runtime, however these objects might not require any attributes of their own, in that case you would use a single instance of every concrete state class that all objects share and of course, the communication overhead between the State and Context objects is obviously another problem. So the state pattern actually introduces an additional communication overhead between the State objects and the Context object. So this could lead to complicated code if a given state requires private details of the context. So once solution to this problem is to make the state classes and inner classes, or as inner classes of the context class.**
