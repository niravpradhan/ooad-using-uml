# 11.5 - Open Closed Principle

**Let's go ahead and look at the OCP or the Open Close principle. Well, for the Open Close Principle classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. The point of this principle is that we should be able to change a class without affecting the clients of that particular class. Again there are two dimensions to this kind of change, change by extending the capabilities of the class and change by modifying the implementation of the class and figure that we see on this slide illustrates this principle when in case we have a grid container class that actually can be extended by adding a line border around the grid, again this extension is made by adding the set border width method. Of course an existing client of this class does not need to be again changed because this behavior does not change the original behavior of the class. Also, the grid container class can be modified because the private implementation of the layout mechanism is hidden from the client. Again in particular the data structure of the component's attribute can be changed from a linear list to a matrix. Again an existing client of this class need not be changed due to this implementation change because the interface has not actually changed.**
