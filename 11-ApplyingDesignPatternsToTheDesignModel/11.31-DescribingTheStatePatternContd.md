**So the next slide actually shows a figure that illustrates the state pattern solution described by the gang of four. Well, in this case, we have the context and again that makes use of a state interface and that state interface typically is implemented by the concrete states, in this case we have a ConcreteStateA, ConcreteStateB, and so forth that implement these interface. Again these would be the implementation or these classes would implement the method handleRequest.**
