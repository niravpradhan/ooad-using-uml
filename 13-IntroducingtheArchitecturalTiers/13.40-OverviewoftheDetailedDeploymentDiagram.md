**Let's look at the overview of the detailed deployment diagram and then in this case we actually look at the client tier. We have the presentation tier again in this particular case, for the client tier, we have a browser, for presentation tier we have a bunch of servlets and JSPs and of course, a bunch of POJO helpers or Java bean helpers. For the business tier, we have the hotel reservation system and again it includes the RMI registry and for the resource tier, we have the database and in this database have different tables. On this particular detailed deployment diagram, we see only the customer table on the database, but again, we have other tables in the database.**
