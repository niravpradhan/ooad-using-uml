**So here is the Data Access Object pattern, again in this case, we have a Data Access Object factory and of course from it we typically, which is an interface in this particular case and it has a couple of methods make a _CarDAO and make DepotDAO. Again, the DepotDAO and of course we have a couple of classes the DAOFactory, RDBMS, and the DAOFactory XML file. These classes implement the DAOFactory interface and of course through them we can actually create the DepotDAO RDBMS and of course, the DepotDAO XML file. And these would be the Data Access Objects that we use to actually create, retrieve, update, and delete information.**
