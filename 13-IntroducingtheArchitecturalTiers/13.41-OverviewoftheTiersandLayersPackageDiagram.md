**So, looking at overview of the tiers and layers package diagram and in this case, we are looking at the resource tier. So, again, because the resource tier, which is the database, lives on the same hardware as the business tier, so that is why its hardware platform is the Athlon server, its slower platform is the Red Hat Linux, its upper platform in this case is the PostgreSQL database, the virtual platform is the SQL DDL, and of course, the application platform is represented by the database schema that actually exist in the database and again the schema represents all the different tables that are mapped to the objects or the Java objects, so for example, we can see the reservation table and of course the customer table, property table, the room table and so forth. And we also saw how actually the relationships are handled, the one to many and the many to many and the one to one and so forth.**
