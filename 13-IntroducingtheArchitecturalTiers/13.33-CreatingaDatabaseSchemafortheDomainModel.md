**Let's go ahead and look at creating a database schema for the domain module. Well, defining the database schema is usually done in two phases. First, we create, again the creation of the logical schema and the creation of the physical schema. Again this section describes typically a simple strategy to map object oriented entities to database tables. So the logical schema is represented by an entity relationship diagram. Again this section pretty much presents a strategy to map domain entities to relational tables. Again, the entity relationship diagram represents the domain entities as relational tables. In every instance of the domain entity class is stored as a single role in the corresponding database table. Again, the attributes of the domain entities are represented as fields within the tables and the associations between domain entities are represented as for in key relationship between tables. Of course the physical entity relationship diagram takes the logical entity relationship diagram and adds data types on fields indexes on tables and data integrity constraints and so on. So the physical entity relationship and adds data types on fields indexes on tables and data integrity constraints and so on. So the physical entity relationship on the logical entity relationship and the physical entity relation diagram that takes again, the logical diagram and of course, like we mentioned, adds the data types on fields indexes on tables and data integrity constraints.**
