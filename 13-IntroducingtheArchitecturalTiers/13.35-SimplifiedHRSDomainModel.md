**Let's look at the simplified hotel reservation system domain module. Again this example uses a simplified domain model, in this where we have a reservation and the customer and we have a relationship of one to many and then again, we have the same thing with the reservation and room, we have a many to many relationship and between the room and property we have again, a many to one or a one to many relationship. So in this particular case, again, step one, we map the object oriented entities to a table. Again, we could represent an entity relationship diagram in UML by using a class diagram. Again, every class node represents a table and we can use the table stereotype to actually clarify that these are database tables. Again, we can call these table nodes.**
