**Let's go ahead and introduce the business tier. Well the business tier primarily contains entity components, service components that perform validation and business rules, and of course, perform updates on the entity components. So again this tier contains the business entity components derived from our domain class model and the business services components discovered using again interaction diagrams. And the business tier may be again accessed by either local components, remote components, for example through the remote method invocation or web service protocols. Again this tier should not need to be changed in order to provide access to a wide range of boundary components.**
