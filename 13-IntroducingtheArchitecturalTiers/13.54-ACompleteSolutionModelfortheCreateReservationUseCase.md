**Letâ€™s go ahead and look at a complete solution model for the Create Reservation use case. In this case, we are making use of the Intranet client, again and those user interfaces are nothing but user interface frames built, again, the main user interface frame, the reservation form user interface frame, the customer management user interface frame, and the pay management user interface frame and all of those are again Swing components and again, they do the same, they make use of the stubs to access, the different services in this case, either the reservation service, the customer service, implementation, or the pay service implementation. Again those they make use of entity components, again, in this case, they are Java beans, property, reservation, room, customer, and payment. And some of those are actually serializable because the property Java bean, the room Java bean, reservation Java bean, customer Java bean, and payment Java bean contain information that actually may be again, used by the customer and that is why they are serializable and copies of those Java beans can actually move to the Intranet client just so that the different user interface frames can make use of those Java bean informations to present information to the customer. Again that information could be related to a customer, reservation, room, property and so forth. And of course, we make use of a bunch of Data Access Objects to access the different tables. In this case, it could be a reservation DAO or a room DAO, or a property DAO or a customer DAO or a payment DAO. And of course, the different tables that we have in the database could be a reservation table, a payment table, property table or room table or a customer table.**
