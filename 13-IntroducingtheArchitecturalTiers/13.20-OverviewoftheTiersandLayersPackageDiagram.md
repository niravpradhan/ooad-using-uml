**Let's go ahead and look at the overview of the tiers and layers package diagram, but in this case, we are pretty much looking at illustrating the client and presentation tier components for the WebPresence application. So we have the thin client, which is again represented in this case by the thin client on the browser and then we have the presentation tier. So in terms of the hardware platform for the thin client, we have _NEPC, for the presentation we decided it is going to be an Athlon hardware system. For the lower platform again on the thin client, we have any OS and on the presentation tier, we have the Linux OS. For the upper platform again for the thin client any browser and for the presentation tier in this case, we have the Tomcat web server that sits on the JVM. And for the visual platform, we have again for the thin client any HTML and for the presentation tier, we have the servelet set act as controllers and the JSPs that act as views. And of course for the application platform for the client is just the client user interface, which is the web page that pretty much plays the role of the user interface to the application and of course, on the presentation tier, we have the web presentation application, which is again implemented using servelets and JSPs.**
