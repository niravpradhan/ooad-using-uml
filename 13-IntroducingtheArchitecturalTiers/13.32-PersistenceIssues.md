# 13.32 - Persistence Issues

**So looking at persistence issues. Well here are few of the persistence issues that must be addressed. First the type of data stored. Again how is the data stored. There are many possibilities including a Flat File Extensible Markup Language like XML, relational database, object oriented, again, database and so forth. And of course, we should look at the database schema that maps the domain model. Again the precision objects in an application usually correspond to the entity specified in the domain model. So we must create a data schema that maps the domain entities, their relationships, and their attributes to the selected data store and of course the integration components. Again there are roughly two types of an integration components. There are technologies that provide hooks to communicate with the external data source, for example the JDBC in the Java technology used to communicate between Java technology program and relational database. And again the details of using JDBC are not covered typically in this course and there are technologies that provide the data access from the business tier components, again that is specified by the DAO, or the Data Access Object pattern, which is an example that we are going to see later on and the current operations are the create, retrieve, update, and delete. Again the current operations are the fundamental operations on a data store.**
