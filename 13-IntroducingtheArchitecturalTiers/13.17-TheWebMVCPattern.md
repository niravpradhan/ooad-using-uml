# 13.17 - The WebMVC Pattern

**Let's go ahead and look at the web MVC pattern. Well a variation on the GUI MVC pattern is usually used to architect the Web User Interface components. With again this pattern, it can be called the Web Model View Controller or the web MVC. Again similar to the GUI version of this pattern, the web MVC provides the separation of constraints between the model, the view, and controller elements of the web application. Again, in this example, on the figure that we see on this current slide describe the responsibilities of these elements. So we see that the view renders the HTML response, request update from model and of course provides HTML forms for user request. On the other hand, the control revise data from the http request maps the user data to the model updates and select view for response and in terms of the model, we actually encapsulates application state, responds to state queries, and expose application functionality. So the main difference between the GUI MVC and the web MVC is that there is no mechanism to update the views when the model changes.**
