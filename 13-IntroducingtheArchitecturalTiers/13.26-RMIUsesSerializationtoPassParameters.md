# 13.26 - RMI Uses Serialization to Pass Parameters

**Let's go ahead and look at RMI that again uses serialization to pass parameters. So the idea here is to have the parameter passing using the RMI. Again methods on a service might pass primitive data values such as integers, floating point numbers, or characters. Again they can also pass objects. To send an object across the network it requires that the data in the object to be sent by by part. Again this process is called object serialization and we can see again the figure that we show on this particular slide illustrates that. So it is important to realize that if an object is created on the application server, when that object is sent to the client application, a new object is created. Again these two objects are duplicates at the moment of transmission, but thereafter the two objects can be changed independently.**
