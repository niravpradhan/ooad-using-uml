**Let's look at the Graphical User Interface screen design. Where the GUI screen usually consists of a set of labels and data entry components such as text field and the figure that we see on the slide shows an example of that. So the visual design of the Graphical User Interface screen is a real art. Again it is beyond the scope of this particular course to discuss the design and layout strategies for a GUI screens. However, you know, we should discuss the Java technologies that support the creation of GUI screens which is the view and off course the event listeners that accept user actions like the controller. Again, the Java technology GUIs are usually constructed with the Swing framework. This framework provides a robust set of low level GUI components such as text fields, labels, buttons, lists, entry components, tables, and so on. And on this particular slide, we see an example of again a figure where that represents customer management screen, where we have a bunch of labels and text fields that allow us to fill in the information about the customer first name, last name, phone number, address, and so forth. And we have a bunch of buttons representing either a search or a new or update or done.**
