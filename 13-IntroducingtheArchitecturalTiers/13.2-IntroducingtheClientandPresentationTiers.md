**Let's go ahead and introduce the client and presentation tiers. Well, the client and presentation tiers primarily contain controller components, which typically control the input from the boundary perform input sanity checking. Again input sanity checking would be to ensure that the data submitted is plausible, for example, it can check that the dates entered are valid, here also called the business logic methods and dispatch a view components. And of course, we have the view components that typically retrieve data required by the view, prepare the view in a format suitable for the recipient, and add client side sanity checking. Again in this case would be a client sanity checking in a web client could be performed by the browser by using Java script. And of course, the whole or part of the boundary may be replaced by an alternative components in order to communicate with different actors. Again human or devices without, again, the necessity to change the business tiers.**
