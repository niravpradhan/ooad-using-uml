**Let's go ahead and look at the overview of the detailed deployment diagram. So if you look at the detailed deployment diagram, we see how the client which is a browser actually invokes an http request on the web server. Again it is typically handled by the reservation controller servelet that will do a lookup for the reservation implementation stub and again that lookup will be done on the RMI registry. Once again the reservation controller servelet gets reference to the reservation service implementation stub, then at that time, we will go ahead and invoke the method on it, which by the way is forwarded through RMI to the reservation service implementation. Again the reservation service implementation will go ahead and create a Java bean called customer, access the database, get the information from the database, puts it in to the Java bean, which is the customer Java bean, which is serializable and of course sends a copy of it through the RMI back to the web server. Of course, the JSPs of the HTML pages will make use of the customer information inside the customer Java bean to actually populate the page and send it back to the client. We also can have an internal client like in this case a booking agent that makes use of an Intranet workstation that again has a user interface application, in this case it has actually a reservation form user interface built again for example, through the or using the Swing API and again we do the same thing. We do a look up for the reservation service implementation stub once we get it, at that time the reservation form user interface will invoke the method on that stub, which again is forwarded through RMI to the reservation service implementation. And of course, the same concept happens where because the Java bean customer or the customer Java bean in this case is serializable. So, a copy of it is, again, moved back to the Intranet work station through the RMI. And again that information which is inside the customer Java bean is used by the reservation form user interface to again view the information about the customer or in this case the customer reservation and so forth.**
