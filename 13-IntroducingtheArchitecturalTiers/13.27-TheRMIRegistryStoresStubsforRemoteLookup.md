# 13.27 - The RMI Registry Stores Stubs for Remote Lookup

**Let's go ahead and look at the RMI registry that stores stubs for remote lookup. So again the idea here is to look at the service look up using RMI. So the client component again must find the remote stub by using another remote application called the RMI registry and the figure that we see in this particular case illustrates that. So if we take a look at this example, we know that when the hotel reservation business application is implemented of course with it or in it we implement a reservation service implementation. So when we implement the class reservation service implementation class, we actually implement also its interface and then that interface is again, which is, in this case is actually now published inside the RMI registry. So that would be step one which is binding the stub in the sense publishing the stub of the interface in the RMI registry. In step number two, what happened in step number two is that the reservation form user interface will go ahead and do a lookup for that particular stub, so now it would be step two that find the stub. So once the reservation form user interface gets a reference to that particular stub then at that time, we will go ahead and make use of that stub to invoke the method on it. Again that method that is invoked on the reservation service implementation stub is forwarded through RMI to the reservation service implementation on the application server.**
