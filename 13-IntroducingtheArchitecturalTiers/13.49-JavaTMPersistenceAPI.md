**Now, looking at the Java Persistence API. Well, the Java Persistence API is actually an alternative to the DAO. Although, the Java persistence API is an alternative to using DAOs, it actually may be possible to use legacy DAOs to use the Java persistence API tool. And therefore, you do not have to change your existing business logic components. Again it helps us, it draws on the best ideas from alternative persistence technology such as Hibernate, TopLink, and Java Data Access Objects or what we call JDAO. There are also uses of persistence providers such as Hibernate or TopLink and it is pretty much a plain old Java object, which is a POJO Persistence API for Object Relational Mapping and of course, uses an entity manager to manage all the objects.**
