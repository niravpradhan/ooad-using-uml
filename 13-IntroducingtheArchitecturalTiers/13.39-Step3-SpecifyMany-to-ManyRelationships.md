**Again let's go ahead and look at the specifying the many to many relationship and we can actually see that in this particular diagram that actually introduces a resolution table that we see on this particular figure on the current slide. So this resolution table is actually called a reservation rooms and we see because we do have a many to many relationship between reservation and room, so to actually resolve the issue of the many to many relationship again, we modeled that using the resolution table. In this example, we actually created a table called reservation rooms that links the reservation and room tables together and again the figure shows how actually this is done. So the reservation rooms table usually contains only the primary keys from each associated table. For example, the reservation ID from the reservation table and the compound key, which is the property ID and the room number from the room table. Again this table will contain a row for each room in a given reservation for all reservations.**
