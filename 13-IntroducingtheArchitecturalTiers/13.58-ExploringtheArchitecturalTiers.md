**After looking at introducing the architecture tiers where we introduce the client and presentation tiers. We also introduced the business tiers. We introduced the resource and integration tiers. And we, of course, introduced the solution model. Let’s go ahead and look at an example that actually illustrates some of the features and concepts that we learned in this particular module. And we start by looking at the tiers and layer diagram of the hotel system that we looked at throughout this particular course. So we see again the client tier and we have the presentation tier, the business tier, the integration tier, and the resource tier. And let’s go ahead and look at the different layers of every single tier. So starting with the hardware platform, on the client tier we have NEPC on the presentation tiers, which represents the Web server, we have a Sun Blade again 6240. And we also know about the business tier and the integration tier are also done in the same machine. So in this case its hardware platform is represented by a Sun Blade T6340. And of course, the resource tier which is in this case at host, the database, the Oracle 11g sits on the Sun Blade 6240. For the lower platform, we see on the client side NEOS on the presentation side we have Solaris 10. And based on again the sys that runs the AMD chip and on the business tier and integration tier. We have a Solaris 10 which actually runs the spark chip and on the resource tier. We have Solaris 10 that runs on the AMD chip. For the upper platform, again, on the client tier we have any browser. On the presentation tier we have Tomcat 6.0 making use of Java SE 6. On the presentation tier and integration tier, we are making use of the Oracle GlassFish application server. And, of course, in the integration tier, we have the Oracle 11g JDBC driver. And on the resource tiers, we have the Oracle 11g. For the virtual platform, on the client side we have HTML, presentation tiers we making use of java server phases, servlets, and JSPs. For the business tier, we are making use of EJBs 3.x. For the integration tier, we are making use of the java persistence API or JPA. And resource, again, we have the SQL DDL. And on the application platform, on the client side we have the client user interphase which is browser the Web page. The presentation tier we have the hotel system web components or application that we created using JSF servlets and JSPs. For the business tier, we have the hotel system business services that we created using EJBs 3.x. In the integration tier, we have the hotel system entities, again, those are the entity classes that make use of JPA to access the database. And of course on the resource we have the database schema. Now, this next slide actually helps us work with well known pattern in the integration tier, which is called a data access object pattern. So in this case we looked at an example where again within the hotel reservation system where we have in this case reservation DIO and interphase. And again it has a bunch of obstruct methods create delete, retrieve, and update and we make the two classes reservation DIO RDBMS and reservation DIO web service implement the create, delete, retrieve, and update methods of the interface reservation DIO. Also, we see a customer DIO interface again that has the obstruct methods create, delete, retrieve, and update. And we make that classes customer DIO RDBMS and customer DIO Web service, classes implement the interface. Again in this case, they would implement the create, delete, retrieve, and update methods. And then we have DIO factory interface, again, that has couple of methods make customer DIO and make reservation DIO. Again, we make the two classes DIO factory RDBMS and DIO factory Web services implement the interface. Again in this case, they would implement the couple of methods that we have see which are make customer DIO and make reservation DIO.**
