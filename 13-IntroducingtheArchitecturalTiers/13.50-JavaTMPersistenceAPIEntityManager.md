**So the Java Persistence API entity manager. Well you know, again, the Java Persistance API EntityManger can actually be requested to manage objects by keeping their data in synchronization with the database record, persist or merge and manage objects, again which makes these objects managed and find an object using the primary key, which again creates an object from the database record.
