**Now let's go ahead and look at the overview of the tiers and layers package diagram, but in this case, we also specify the integration tier. Now we should remember that the integration tier is also the same hardware as the business tier and the resource tier. So that is why for the hardware platform is the Athlon server, for the lower platform for the integration tier is the Linux Red Hat, and of course the upper platform would be the PostDriver again, that sits on the JVM and of course for the visual platform making use of the JDBC API and for the application would be the DAOs that we actually create that help us access the database tables to retrieve again records or update records and so forth.**
