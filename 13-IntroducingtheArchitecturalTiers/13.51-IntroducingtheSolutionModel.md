# 13.51 - Introducing the Solution Model

**Let's go ahead and look at the solution model. Whether the solution model is the basis upon which the development team will construct the code of the system solution. Again the figure that we see here, it shows the solution model which is constructed by merging the analysis model into the architectural model template. Again conceptually, the solution model represents the primary software components that solve a use case. Again because this model is very close to the actual code that will be developed. Again these models can be quite large. So it is not always a good idea to develop a complete solution model, but this model again can be invaluable to a novice development team. And of course, the solution model can be presented by actual code. For example, if the architecture team built an architecture baseline then the structure of this code again set can act as a solution model for the development team.**
