**Looking at the GUI event model. Well, the Java technology makes use of event listeners mechanism. Again a GUI must also provide the mechanism to retrieve user actions such as a clicking on a button, entering a text in a text field, tracking the mouse over a graphic and so on. So in the Swing framework, this action is achieved using a component called a listener. Again, a listener response to the type of operations allowed for a GUI component. For example, a button can be pressed by clicking a button on your mouse. Again Swing includes about a dozen different listeners. It is beyond the scope of this course to discuss all these listeners. And the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates the activation of an action listener object when the update button is pressed. Again the Swing framework provides for the operating system hooks that intercept the mouse button action. Again when a button is pressed, the GUI component for that button is notified, which again triggers any and all action listener objects that have registered with that button. For example, the update button listener might store the name, the phone number, the address data into the customer object and then call the save method on the customer service class. So, again on this particular slide, we see how when the booking agent presses the update button send an action performed trigger on, again, the action listener.**
