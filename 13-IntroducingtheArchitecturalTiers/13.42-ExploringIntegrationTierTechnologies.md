**Now let's go ahead and explore the integration tier technology. In the sense, we are going to look at the integration tier. So, again in this case, we are trying to find out what type of technologies we can use in the integration tier. So the integration tier separates the entity components from the resource tier, which is a database. And resources that require integrations are typically database resources like database in all kind of databases for storage. The Enterprise Information Systems, this would be any mainframe type of systems. The computational libraries, again a computation library is any software system that provides a mathematical or simulation capabilities. Message services, again this would be any tool that enables independent application to communicate using asynchronous messages and B2B or business to business services, again this would be a service that integrates two or more applications across multiple companies.**
