**So again, looking at the Web User Interface screen design, some considerations affect the design of the Web User Interface screens. It is typically a Web User Interface tends to be constructed as a sequence of related screens and every screen is a hierarchy of user interface components and of course the Web User Interface screen represents the users view of the domain model as well as represents the users action control and of course it is rare that a screen can be reused by multiple use cases. What I mean by that is because the Web User Interface screens tend to be designed specifically for a single use case. So again, this usually presents these components from being reused in other use case workflows.**
