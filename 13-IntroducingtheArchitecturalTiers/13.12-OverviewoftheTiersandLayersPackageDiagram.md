**Let's go ahead and look at an overview of the tiers and layers package diagram. So the figure that we see on this slide illustrates an example of tiers and layer package diagram for the hotel application service. In this particular case, we have the client as a standalone client, which pretty much represents any PC, any OS for the hardware platform, we can use any PC for the lower platform, we can use any OS for the upper platform, we have the Java SC, for the visual platform, we have the Swing API and of course, for the application, we have the hotel application interface, a standalone interface application. Again bill for example, using the Swing API.**
