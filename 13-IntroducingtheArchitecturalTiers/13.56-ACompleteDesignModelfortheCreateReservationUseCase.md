**And here is the complete design model for the create reservation use case, but this kind in thiscase, making use of the Web User Interface. So we see now, that we have actually a bunch of pages that represent the room select or the search results or the confirmation reservation or the view reservation and so forth or the customer login information or the create customer and so forth. All these are different pages, okay and of course we also have controllers and one of them is called make a reservation controller, the other one is called customer controller. And of course, we have a bunch of services and these are reservation service, customer service, payment service, login service, and a bunch of entities representing property, reservation, room, customer, and payment.**
