**This next slide actually shows us a complete analysis model for the create reservation user interface. Well in this case, we have a bunch of boundaries like the main user interface, the reservation form user interface, the customer management user interface, and the pay management user interface. We also have a bunch of service components and they are the reservation service, the customer service, and the pay service. And of course, we have a bunch of entity components and they are represented by the property entity, the reservation entity, room entity, customer entity, and payment entity.**
