**Now this next slide actually shows us GUI listeners as controller elements. So in this particular slide, we see on the figure how the search action listener, the new action listener, the update action listener are inner classes inside the customer user interface and they play the role of controllers. And of course, in the view we have a bunch, again, we could register those as listeners and again, they are represented or they are listeners to the different buttons, in this case, the search JButton, the new:JButton and update:JButton.**
