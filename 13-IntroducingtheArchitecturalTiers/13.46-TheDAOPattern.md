**Moving along and let's go ahead now and look at the DAO pattern and in this case, we are looking at it within the integration tier. So the figure that we see on this slide actually illustrates how the business tier components depend on the integration tier components to interact with the data store, in this case, making use of the customer DAO RDBMS that is actually created through the DAOFactory RDBMS. Again in this case the reservation service implementation makes use of the customer DAO to access the database and of course grab the information related to the customer or retrieve the information related to the customer.**
