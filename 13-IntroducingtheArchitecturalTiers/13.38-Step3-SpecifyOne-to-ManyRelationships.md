**So, here is the next slide that actually specifies the one to many relationships. So in this particular case, we make use of foreign keys to actually represent that relationship and we see how in the reservation table, we actually have the foreign key represented in this case, by customer ID and because we have a many to one relationship between the reservation and the customer. And also we can see that between the property and room, where in the room table, we actually have again, in this case, a property ID that represents the foreign key. Again this case would be the property ID, where the room is located.**
