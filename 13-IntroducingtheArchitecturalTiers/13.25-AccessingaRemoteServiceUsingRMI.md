# 13.25 - Accessing a Remote Service Using RMI

**So, looking at accessing a remote service using RMI. Again in this case, the RMI mechanism actually allows us to have the reservation form user interface that calls the local reservation service implementations stub, which is the interface and that reservations stub implementation would actually be or the reservation service implementations stub will actually access the reservation service implementation through RMI. So, again, in this case, this figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates this simplified architecture. So we should notice that the diagram shows the stub communicating directly with the business application component. Again, the diagram does not show the real component that the stub talks to directly because this, again, is hidden from the system as part of the RMI runtime environment.**
