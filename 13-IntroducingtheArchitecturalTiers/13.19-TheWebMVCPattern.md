**Now again talking about the web MVC pattern, so the model two architecture uses again these components. So the Java servelet acts actually as a controller to process http request. Typically it verifies the HTML form data, update the business model, and select and dispatch to the next view. And we have the Java Server Pages. Again technology that acts as the views that are sent to the user and of course the Java technology classes whether, again, they are local or distributed act as the model for the business services and entities.**
