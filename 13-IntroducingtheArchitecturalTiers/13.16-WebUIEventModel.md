**Looking at the web user event model. Well a Web User Interface application has radically different event processing model than the Graphical User Interface application. Again, there are two types of events. The micro events that can be handled by Java script technology code, again small scale events occur as the user clicks on a user interface components, enters texts and changes the focus from one user interface component to another. Again these events can only be handled by the web browser. Again Java script technology is useful for handling such micro events and we have the macro events rather are handled as http requests from the web browser to the web server. Again, large scale events occur as the user clicks on a link or submits an HTML form. Again, these events are sent through web server as an http request. This request will include all the HTML form data, if any.**
