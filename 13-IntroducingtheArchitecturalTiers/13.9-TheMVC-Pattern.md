**Let's go ahead and look at the MVC pattern. Well the MVC is another Graphical User Interface architectural pattern. Again this pattern is an example of the separation of concerns principle in which the model element again, which represented by the business entities and services are kept separate from the Graphical User Interface views and controller mechanisms. Again, the MVC pattern uses a notification mechanism similar to that used in Swing. So, a view component can actually register with the model to listen to events when the model changes and the figure that we see on this particular slide illustrates the responsibilities of every element in the MVC pattern. Again in this case, the model, the view, and the controller. So, we see that on the view again, we display information to the user, implements the update procedure, and retrieves data from the model and for the controller it typically accepts user input as events, translates events to service request for the model, translates events to display request for the view, and for the model it typically provides functional core of the application and notifies dependent components about data changes.**
