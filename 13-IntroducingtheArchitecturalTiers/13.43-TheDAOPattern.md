**And because we are talking about the integration tier, let's go ahead and discuss now a well known pattern called the DAO pattern also is called the Data Access Object pattern. Again this pattern is very useful because it separates the implementation of the CRUD operations from the application tier. It also encapsulates the data storage mechanism for the CRUD operations for a single entity with one Data Access Object component for every entity and it provides an abstract factory for the DAO components if the storage mechanism is likely to change.**
