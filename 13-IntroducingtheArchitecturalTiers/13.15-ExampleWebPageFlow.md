**And here is an example of web page flow and again the figure that we see on this particular slide shows an example of sequence of Web User Interface pages for the hotel reservation system. Again the sequence implements the create reservation online. So we see how we have the room selection, specify the search again will invoke the caller's search results and then from it we choose a room, again, we have the customer login and then from it we again have, in our case here, if it is a new customer, we create a new customer, otherwise again, after that we go ahead and confirm reservation and through the confirmation we view the reservation information.**
