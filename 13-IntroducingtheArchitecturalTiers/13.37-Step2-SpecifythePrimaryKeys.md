**Step two will specify the primary keys. Again in this case, the primary key of a relational table is a set of fields that uniquely identify every object in the table. Again, that is to say that a row represents a single domain object of the and the primary key is the unique identifier of that particular object. And again, there are two types of entities. There is the independent entities. Again, an independent entity is one that exists independently of all other entities in the domain model. Again in the hotel reservation system, the reservation, customer, and property entities are independent. And of course, we have the dependent entities. A dependent entity is one that exists within the context of another entity. Again this entity usually exists in a composition relationship. For example, a hotel room exists only within .the context of a hotel property. So the room entity depends upon, in this case, the hotel property because the property contains of course, a bunch of rooms and looking at the tables we actually can see the primary keys, but then in the room we also see a property ID that represents the foreign key. So in this case, we see how the room depends on the property. So we see we have the room number that plays a role of the primary key, but then also we have the property ID that represents the foreign key.**
