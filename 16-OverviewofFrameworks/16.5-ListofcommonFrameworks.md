**Let's look at the list of common frameworks. For example we have Ruby on Rails as a free software application framework for the Ruby platform using the modeled view controller architecture for rapid web application, so is actually very useful for rapid web application. We have the Spring framework again that is open source application framework for the Java platform and the .NET framework primarily used for the business tiers but it has extensions for building the web presentation tier. Again it is often used in conjunction with Hibernate and as an alternative to the Java EE application server. We have the JSF framework that is an open source web application framework again for the Java platform which uses a component-based and event-driven approach for rapid application development. We have the Hibernate that’s again on open source Java-based framework to perform object, relational mapping, and queries. Again this framework fits into the integration tier. We have Struts again that’s a well known one. As a free open source framework for creating web applications based on Java JSPs again it helps in servlets of course. It helps developers achieve separation of concerns of the modeled view and controller by using the MVC architecture. We have the Microsoft.NET that’s again software framework designed to run on Microsoft windows operating system. We have Struts 2 that’s an open source framework for web application development with improved features over Struts. Again the improvement includes POJO form and actions.**
