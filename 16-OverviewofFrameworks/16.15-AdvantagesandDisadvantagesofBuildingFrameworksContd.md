# 16.15 - Advantages and Disadvantages of Building Frameworks (Contd.)

**Where we should also not forget that frameworks do have again disadvantages. So the disadvantages of building a framework typically include the fact that it could be expensive to build. So the cost to build a generic framework will be high because the developer has to consider all the possible use cases in which the framework will be used and provide a flexible framework to accommodate the specific domain versions and that actually could be a problem, also it requires an excellent knowledge of all the domains that the framework will be used for. So we really have to have a very good expert knowledge to be able to do that. So we need access to domain experts in all of the specific domains that the framework will be used for and the code may become bloated due to the one size fits all approach of the framework, also the framework code and specific version code combine will always be greater than a version within from scratch and frameworks may be difficult to learn of course too, so we are talking about the learning curve that could be very steep and we are also restricted by the infrastructure and cannot usually modify the infrastructure files, so if the developers of the framework did not consider all the possible use cases then the framework may not fit, for example consider a vehicle domain framework envisage design to be used for vehicles of land, water or air. If the framework used an attribute of weight, this would again cause a problem in a case where the framework gets used for space vehicles, where again an attribute of mass would be more appropriate.**
