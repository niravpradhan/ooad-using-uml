**Let's look now at building frameworks. Well a generic framework can be actually built for a specific business domain. Generic attributes and methods could be specified in the framework and the generic classes could have associations with other generic classes and link attribute methods could be specified in the framework classes. So for example an insurance company could create a generic insurance framework that again which support any insurance domain product. For example pet insurance, car insurance, life insurance, property insurance, public liability insurance and so forth.**
