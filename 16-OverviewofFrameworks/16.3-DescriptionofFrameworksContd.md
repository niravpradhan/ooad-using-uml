**A framework can actually provide the infrastructure for one or more tiers such as a web presentation, business services, entities, and integration tiers. Again this infrastructure files will often facilitate the non-business oriented tasks required by software systems such as transactions, security, or object life cycle management. Also the framework can provide the infrastructure for a specific business domain for example insurance, banking, or oil exploration. Again these infrastructure files are created and packaged, but are usually used internally within an organization. Of course, the infrastructure provided by the framework are also a shared business domain requirement such as resource allocation, event management, or billing.
