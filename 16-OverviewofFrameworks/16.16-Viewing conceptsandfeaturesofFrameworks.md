**After looking at an overview of frameworks where we looked at advantages and disadvantages of using frameworks, we also looked at building frameworks and we looked at advantages and disadvantages of building frameworks. Let's go ahead and look at an example that illustrates the concepts and features that we learned in this module. Again in this particular slide, we are looking at identifying potential frameworks that could be shared again by the applications in this case a hotel system, a car rental system, and a private hospital system. So what we are going to do is identify how actually we can create this framework and we are going to look at what type of classes we can actually create that will be part of this framework that actually can work for the three applications which are in this case the hotel system, the car rental system, and a private hospital system. So looking at the current slide, we see some of the classes that actually we can use, again, this is one of the possible solutions where we have ResourceUser class again and it has an association with an Event so ResourceUser, again, so the Event used by ResourceUser and we have a relationship one-to-many between the ResourceUser and the Event. Again the Event has ResourceAllocation and again you know that ResourceAllocation class has an association that one-to-many association with time period and the ResourceAllocation has, again, in this case a Resource, so Resource can have zero or more ResourceAllocation and, of course, the Resource has an association with the ResourceType, so ResourceType describes the Resource. Also, the Event has an association with charges. Again an Event can have zero or more Charges and, of course, we have an association between Charges and ChargeableItem class and in this case we can say that Charges can have zero or more ChargeableItems and also we have an association between ChargeableItem and ChargeableItemType. So we should note that in a private hospital, again, we may need multiple Resources for different time ranges, for example, a room and the operating theater and, of course, intensive cares nurse, we should in the notary we also should say that some Resources such as medication may not need to be allocated for a time range, again therefore time range is optional and as a note for we should also say that in some cases it might be useful to actually associate ChargeableItem with ResourceAllocation. The next slide shows us an abstract of a private hospital system using this generic framework that we actually discussed in the previous slide, so what’s in the yellow, the classes in yellow are actually the generic framework classes and what’s in blue are the classes related to the hospital system. So we see how a HospitalStay, again, inherits from Event, the Patient inherits from ResourceUser, the HospitalBill inherits from the Charges class and the HospitalResource inherits from the Resource class, and the HospitalResourceType inherits from the ResourceType. Again the framework classes as shown in like I said in yellow would be the framework classes and what’s in blue represent the classes of the private hospital system.**
