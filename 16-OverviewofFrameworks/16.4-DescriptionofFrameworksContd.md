**Customization of a framework is done again by extending framework classes or implementing framework interfaces. Again you can implement the framework interfaces or extend the framework abstract classes and provide the specific method implementation required by the framework. Again in this customization process, we typically have our classes that may be less coherent due to again to their mixed responsibilities and of course our classes may be more difficult to test outside the framework and informing the framework of the Plain Old Java Object (POJO) classes, it must again managed by using configuration files or annotations. POJOs do not extend or implement the framework classes or interfaces, but typically are configured using configuration files or annotations. Again these are added to your source POJO files and POJOs often allow the framework to be placed or replaced with minimal effort, again in this customization process typically POJOs tend to be more coherent and POJOs can be easier to test outside of the framework environment.**
