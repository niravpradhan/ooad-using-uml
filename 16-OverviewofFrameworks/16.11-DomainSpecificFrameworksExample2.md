**The second example which is again representing the domain specific frameworks, this actually show a framework of interfaces and abstract classes. What we see here again whatâ€™s in yellow are the classes in yellow are the interfaces again that are in yellow are part of the framework classes and the one in blue are the classes in blue represent the pet insurance classes. So we see that in this case in the framework classes we have a bunch of interfaces, we have the premium calculation rule interface, we have the premium calculation rules interface, we have the policy holder interface, insurance policy interface, insured article interface, and we have a bunch of classes that do implement these interfaces, again these are the premium calculation rule implementation, premium calculation rules implementation, policy holder implementation, insurance policy implementation and insured article implementation and of course below we see the blue classes and those are related to the pet insurance and they are similar to the ones that we have seen in the previous slide.**
