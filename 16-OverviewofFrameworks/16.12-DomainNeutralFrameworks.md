# 16.12 - Domain Neutral Frameworks

**Let's look now at domain natural frameworks. Well domain network frameworks are often used for subsystems. Again these frameworks contain common features required by a variety of different domains, again for example we have a used car sales system could use a trading framework and a billing framework and a human resource system could actually use resource allocation framework. The generic patterns are often called analysis patterns, for example one of such pattern is the party which is person or company, place, thing, event. Again this forms the basis of event planing or resource scheduling. However these may be far too abstract and generic to be used in an application.**
