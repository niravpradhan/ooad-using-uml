# 15.31 - 80/20 Rule

**Looking at 80-20 rule. Well in an iterative and incremental development process, again we do not need to fully understand every aspect before moving to the next step so the 80-20 rule can be applied, for example for the 20% of the effort we can understand 80% of the details and for 20% of the effort your specification can achieve 80% accuracy. Again missing details and accuracy are found in the subsequent iterations for a fraction of the effort. Again this rule works only if the software that you build is flexible. In the OO paradigm when applied correctly is flexible with changes been predominantly additive or subtracted.**
