**Let's look at producing an iteration plan, well iteration plan contains the use cases that we intend to develop in each iteration, again in the UP this plan partly occurs during the inception phase and is completely defined by the end of the elaboration phase, the assessment criteria includes again the following items. Use case priority, use case risk, architectural significance, estimated time to develop a use case and dependency on other use cases. So the use case form and the supplementary specification document contains again these information. The next slide actually shows us a subset of the use cases for a library system, again that are at least for use cases even for the simplest library system and in this particular case we have a librarian, we have again use cases add a member, delete a member, borrow a book, return a book, we have again to include in this case from the borrowed book and they return a book to the identifying the book. We also have the extent from the return book to again pay fine again pay by cash or pay by card. And we also have the enter code manually and scan the book ID. And we have an actor which is the time trigger.**
