**Let's look at choosing Scrum, well when should we use Scrum. Well when priorities of the requirements are constantly changing again features to be developed in H Sprint are decided at the beginning of the Sprint and not at the beginning of the project. Of course we use it when also we need to deliver a working increment of the software every 30 days. Now the issues with choosing the Scrum are first requires a committed team again every Sprint team is responsible for the delivery of that Sprint increment. And of course the other issue is the primary focus is on the functional requirement of every Sprint. And then non-functional requirements might not be considered adequately.**
