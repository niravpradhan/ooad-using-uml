**Looking at the architecture baseline, again an architecture baseline is a subset of the system requirements that are again realized in code early in the project and tested to prove that the chosen architecture satisfies major nonfunctional requirements. Again the baseline code includes architectural significant use cases and in this process of testing these architectural significant use cases is often called architectural proof-of-concept. In a Unified Process the architectural baseline must be completed at the end of the elaboration phase.**
