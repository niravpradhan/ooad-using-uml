**Let's go ahead and producing an iteration plan, well the table that we see on the slide actually shows an example of information that we might use to determine the iteration plan, again in practice we might not need to build a table as all the information should exist in issues case form and supplementary specification documentation but here we just show an example and in this particular case again itâ€™s a sample iteration plan details where we have the use case name priority risk, architectural significance and dependency, for example we start we return a book, priority must have risk medium, the architectural significance must be complete within 60 seconds and easy to use and the dependency makes use of borrowed book. Again pay fine again we should have it risk is medium, architecture significance is none and of course the dependency return a book. Pay fine by cash again should have it risk low, architecture significance none and of course the dependency pay fine, pay fine by card again could have it in this case for the priority risk high, the transaction with the external system must be completed within 30 seconds and again the dependency pay fine. Next slide is the continuation of this table where we have again the next borrowed book again with its priority risk architecture significant dependency, same thing with the identifying the book, entering a code manually, scan a book ID, delete a member, and send a mail short. Again we see that some of them must have it, some of them should have it and for example the last one could have it. In terms of the priorities, we see a medium for the first two ones, the third one is the low, the fourth one is the medium and the last two ones are low and of course in terms of the architectural significance we actually see that the borrowed book must complete within 60 seconds, again the identify a book should complete within 15 seconds, enter a code manually, complete within 15 seconds and scan a book should complete within 7 seconds and in terms of the dependency we see that the first one again depend on add a book, add a member, identify a member. Second one depends on add a book. Third one depends again dependencies identify a book and the last two ones depend on add a member.**
