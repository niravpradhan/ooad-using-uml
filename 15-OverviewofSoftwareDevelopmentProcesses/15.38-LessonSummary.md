**So in summary in this module, we reviewed the iterative and incremental development. We looked at the architecture-centric development, we looked at the projects risks and constraints, we looked at developing an iteration plan based on the use cases, priority risk and architecture significance and again no one methodology fits every organization or project, so we can actually create our own methodology by adapting an existing methodology to suit our requirements and by again following the best practices.**
