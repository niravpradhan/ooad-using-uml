**Let's go ahead and look now at the best design best practices. Well understanding and applying design-level best practices can actually improve the flexibility and extensibility of a software solution. Again we will be introduced to these best practices through again throughout this particular course. And the best practices include again the design principles where again these design principles are rules about how software components interact or are combined to provide flexibility, extensibility and decoupling. Again these principles provide the rules from which patterns arise or software patterns. Again a software pattern is a repeatable solution to a recurring problem within a context. Refactoring again, refectoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code. Yet improves its internal structure, again some blueprints which is again Sun Microsytems now again owned by Oracle publishes documents that bring together best practices in a wide variety of technical areas including Java EE development, cluster configurations, and so on.**
