**Let's look at the project constraints, well project development constraints are often confused with the non-functional requirements which are again the runtime constraints of the system. So the project constraints primarily focus on constraints during the development process. The typical project constraints again are project must be developed on a specific platform example the application of the web server must run on for example Sun hardware or Oracle Sun hardware. Project requires specific technologies may be for example Java EE technologies, web services technologies and so forth and project has fixed deadline, again this would be project must be ready by the next for example Olympic Games as an example. And the system interacts with specific external systems, again integration with specific external systems is an important constraint on the project.**
