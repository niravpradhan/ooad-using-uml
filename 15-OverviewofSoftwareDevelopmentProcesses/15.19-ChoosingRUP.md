**Let's go ahead and look now at choosing the Rational Unified Processing. Again for when to use it again the same reason as the UP or may be your company owns the Rational's tool set. Now the issues that we have with the Rational Unified Processing is that are the same issues that we saw in the UP. Again because the Rational Unified Processing is based on UP then we have the same issues as the UP. Again the tool set learning curve might be again a little bit steep. So again there are many tools used in the rational user unified processing, again there is a steep learning curve to actually use these tools properly within the IUP methodology. And tools lock the team into a process. Again the tool set will lock you into the IUP methodology.**
