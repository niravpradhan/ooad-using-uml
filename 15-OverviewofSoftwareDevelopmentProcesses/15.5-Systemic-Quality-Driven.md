**Let's look at the systematic-quality-driven, so to complete requirements of software system again include functional and non-functional requirements. So, systemic qualities is the name given to non-functional requirements by the SunTone methodology or architecture methodology. Again a related term is quality of service which refers to the qualitative characteristics of the system and again examples include performance, reliability, scalability, and so forth. So, systemic qualities drive the architecture baseline of the software. After the architecture baseline has been developed, the software designers can actually craft the remaining functional requirements into this baseline.**
