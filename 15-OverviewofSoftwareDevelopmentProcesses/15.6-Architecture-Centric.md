**Let's look at the architecture-centric, well, architecture is all about capturing the strategic aspect of the high level structure of the system. Again many areas of risks in software project involve quality of service issues such as scalability, availability, extensibility of course. And the architecture workflow deals with these issues, again therefore it is a best practice to perform the architecture workflow as early in the development process as possible. Again this practice mitigates risks earlier in the process rather than later. Again looking at the strategic aspects, again there are systemic qualities again that drive the architecture components and of course in this case and patterns. And of course use cases must fit into the architecture. So the architecture baseline defines the structure into which all of the design components must fit. And the high-level structure is of course tiers such as clientâ€™s business and resources. And of course tier components and their communication protocol. So the components in layers and tiers must be able to communicate to get their work done. And layers such as application platform and hardware again in a component based system an application layer components are built upon specific APIs.**
