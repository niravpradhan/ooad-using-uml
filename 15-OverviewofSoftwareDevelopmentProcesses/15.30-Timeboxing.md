**Looking at Timeboxing again every iteration in an iterative incremental development process has a fixed time duration. Again this process is called time boxing and the key features of time boxing are the iteration must complete on schedule even if the chosen set of use cases are not completely developed the iteration completes on schedule. And unfinished use cases are re-scheduled in the next iteration. Again we should avoid continues re-scheduling of specific use case.**
