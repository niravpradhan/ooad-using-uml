**Looking at the architectural significance, we should say that use cases are architecturally significant if they have projects critical non-functional requirements. Again these non-functional requirements determine the success or failure of the project. And of course the project critical non-functional requirements require the architect to choose an architecture that satisfies those non-functional requirements, so for example performance and scalability non-functional requirements can affect the distribution of major components and the number of type of every server.**
