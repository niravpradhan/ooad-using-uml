**The next methodology that we would like to discuss is eXtreme programming. Well eXtreme programming nominates coding as the key activity throughout a software project. Again the eXtreme programming is one of the several relatively new methodologies called agile methodologies. Again in many ways the XP is dramatic departure from traditional methodologies. Again XP focuses on facilitation of change and communication within the team and with the clients. And in this case, the few key ideas are pair programming where if code reviews are good then review code all the time and testing if testing is good to t
est all the time, even the customers. And if factoring, again if design is good then make it part of everybodyâ€™s daily business and simplicity again if simplicity is good then always leave this system with the simplest design. The next again slide shows us the XP methodology diagram. So again iterative development is essential and is taken through the extreme with XP, small almost daily releases are built from user storage which are again also called use case scenarios.**
