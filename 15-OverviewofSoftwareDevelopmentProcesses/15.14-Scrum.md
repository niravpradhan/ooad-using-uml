**The next one that we would like to discuss is the Scrum. Again the Scrum is an iterative and incremental development framework that is often used in conjunction with the agile software development. Again Scrum framework includes a set of practices and roles, again the key features of Scrum are that every Sprint is typically 15-30 days and produces a deliverable increment of software. Again every like we mentioned and a subset of features or requirements are moved from the Product backlog to the Sprint backlog at the beginning of every Sprint. Again the product backlog is the high level document containing system requirement estimates of priorities and the required development effort. And the requirements in the Sprint backlog are developed during the Sprint. Again every Sprint produces a version of the software that the client can actually use. Next the Sprint progress is reviewed every 24 hours in a daily Scrum. Of course the Scrum framework requires a team-oriented responsibilities. The next slide shows us the Scrum development methodology. Again in this case it is pretty much the diagram where we have the product backlog and then next will be the Sprint backlog and then the Sprint. And we finished with the working increment of the software.**
