**Well letâ€™s look at producing an iteration plan, so iteration plans are mainly applicable to iterative and incremental development processes. Again these plans determine the order in which the software components are developed. Again if you are using a use-case-driven methodology or a similar technology we should consider each use case based on the priority risk and of course dependencies. And the iteration plan might again be documented in detail early in the project and rigidly followed or might be loosely planned and open for change as the project progresses.**
