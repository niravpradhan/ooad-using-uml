**Let's go ahead and look at the use case driven, well, a software system is brought into existence to serve its users. So to know understand again how the software system is to be built again we must first understand what functions the system needs to perform for the users of the system. Again this means that the whole development process is use-case-driven because use case has captured the functional requirements of the system. And again the following are some of the main issues. Again all software has users and they are typically humans or machines. Again these are called actors and the term user and actor are used interchangeably in this particular course, so an actor in some entity outside of the system such as a human user or an external system for example a credit card authorization system. Users also use software to perform activities or accomplish goals. Again these are called use cases. Other methodologies might call these user stories, but again the idea is the same. A software development methodology supports the creation of software that facilitates use cases and use cases drive the design of system. So the design workflow takes the use cases and creates a set of software components that implement the functionality specified in the use case again the design solution model is then used to implement the software system.**
