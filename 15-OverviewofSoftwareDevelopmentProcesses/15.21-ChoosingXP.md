**Letâ€™s look at choosing eXtreme programming. Again why we should use eXtreme programming. Well first company culture that permits experimentation, again the XP methodology is radical departure from the traditional development processes like we said earlier. We can also use it when for small, close (proximity) teams with flexible work spaces. Again pair programming and flexible open work spaces are fundamental to the XP development process. We also use it when team must have as many experienced developers as inexperienced. And of course we use it when requirements change frequently. So, one of the greatest benefits of XP is that the process easily supports changing requirements. Again it has some issues and we should not use XP when again because it tends to be documented light. So user stories and the code are documented by using the XP methodology. Again XP discourages creating models so design is done in real time and documented in the code.**
