# 15.18 - Choosing UP

**Letâ€™s look at choosing UP, again when to use UP, well typically it is either company culture which is process-oriented or teams with members that have flexible job roles, again while UP encourages the delineation of job roles it is not an as strict again about the separation of workflows and the distinctions of job roles that perform every workflow which again is the hallmark of the Waterfall methodology. Again it is also useful for medium to large-scale projects. Again projects of creation size or a certain size required documentation, so that all of the stakeholders of the project can understand the problem and solution domains clearly. And it is also used when requirements are allowed to change. Again because UP uses an iterative process or requirements changes can actually be folded into later iterations. Now the issues that we have when choosing the UP is that it tends to be process and documentation heavy. And of course this is an overkill for small projects. So for small projects it might not be useful to actually use this methodology.**
