**Now looking at choosing Waterfall, again when to use this. Well typically Waterfall is used when large teams, again we have large teams with distinct roles. Again large teams require a great deal of structure to support the communication problems between developers and sub teams and of course we can also use it when in this case when to choose again a Waterfall when the project is not risky. Again this is the most important factor in deciding to use Waterfall. Now looking at issues with choosing again Waterfall methodology. Well it is not resilient to requirement changes. So it is difficult to actually go back to a previous workflow to make changes to the system if we are again following the Waterfall methodology. And it tends actually to be documentation heavy, so the Waterfall methodology depends on a well defined documentation deliveries between workflows.**
