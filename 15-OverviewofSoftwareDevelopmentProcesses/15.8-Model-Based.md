**Now letâ€™s go ahead and look at the model-based, well models are the primary means of communication between all stakeholders in the software project. So artifacts are physical representations of our mental models. Again modeling is a functional property of how human think. So, whether explicit or not all humans have mental models of reality and the systems that they develop. Again the choice to give these models physical representations through an artifact is a decision of the project manager. Again there are several types of model artifacts, their textual documents, again the requirement specification and use case scenarios require both formal and informal text. UML diagrams again the UML provides a rich set of diagrams to represent visual views of our mental models of the proposed software system. And of course prototypes, again prototypes are small scale software systems built to model a certain aspect of the proposed software system. In terms of the models they can actually serve many purposes. And some of these purposes are communication where model artifacts communicate your mental models to other project stakeholders. Problem solving where some models can actually be constructed to solve a particular difficult problem. And proof-of-fconcept where against models are created to demonstrate the feasibility of a concept.**
