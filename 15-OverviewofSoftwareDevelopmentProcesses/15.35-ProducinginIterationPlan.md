**After looking at an overview of software development processes where we looked at exploring methodology best practices, we also looked at surveying several methodologies, we looked at choosing a methodology, we looked at project constraints and risks and we looked at producing an iteration plan. Let's go ahead and look at an example that illustrates some of the features that we learnt in this particular module particularly when I look at producing an iteration plan. Again we are still thinking about the hotel system and we want to produce an iteration plan. So the idea is to again reassess the priorities and risks for the use case form for this particular use case, which is hotel system, assess the priorities and risks for the remaining use cases that we discovered and, of course, assess the architecture significance of every use case and construct an iteration plan based on our study. So we again on this slide, we actually see an abstract of suggested hotel system iteration plan. Again the plan might vary as the assessment of risk and priority is typically subjective and we see on this table, again, looking at the elaboration, we have iteration 2 and 3 where we can create reservation and then perform card payment transaction and then, on the construction, we have iteration 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and 9 in this case where we perform payment cash transaction, update reservation, delete reservation, request list of vacated rooms, retrieve reservation statistics, publish special promotions to customers. Again looking at the simulation customer data, we can actually add in the elaboration add charge to the customer’s bill in iteration 3, and then under the construction in iteration 4, we create a customer, 5, we identify the existing reservations, 6 create a promotion, 7 mark room ready for use, 8 modify promotion, 9 notify guest of today’s reservation. Again looking at the elaboration iteration 2 check in customer, iteration 3 check out customer that’s under the elaboration, and under the construction we have iteration 4 change room phone status, iteration 5 add customer’s bill, 6 register customer loyalty card, 7 generate nightly reports, 8 generate discrepancy report, and 9 modify customer. Handle simulation change room phone status that would be again located under the elaboration iteration 2 and of course for the add loyalty points that would be under the constructed iteration 6.**
