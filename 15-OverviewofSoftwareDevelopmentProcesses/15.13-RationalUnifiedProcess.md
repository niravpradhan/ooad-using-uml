**Looking at the Rational Unified Process, well this is a commercial version of the unified processing methodology created by Grady Booch, Jacobson, and of course Rumbaugh and the RUP is a UP with the support of rational tool set. Again this tool manages, the phases, workflows, and artifacts throughout the project life cycle. And the next slide shows us pretty much a figure that shows the rational tool set for the Rational Unified Process methodology. Again we see the different phases and of course the different tools that are used within this suite.**
