**Let's look at the Waterfall, where the Waterfall methodology is one of the oldest development processes. Again it is presented here as a baseline to evaluate other methodologies and the Waterfall methodology again has a bunch of characteristics. The Waterfall uses a single phase in which all workflows proceed in a linear fashion. This methodology does not support iterative development. Again this methodology works best for a project in which all requirements are known at the start of the project and requirements are not likely to change and again some government contracts might require again this type of methodology and some consulting firms used this methodology in which each workflow is contracted with a fixed-price bid and the next slide actually shows us the figure that shows us the Waterfall methodology, it starts with requirement gathering, requirement analysis, architecture design, implementation, testing, and deployment.**
