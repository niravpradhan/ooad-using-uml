**Reviewing the software methodology, well, again as described in the describing software methodology, we typically say that methodology describes the top level organization of a software development project. Again the structure usually includes phases, workflows, activities, and artifacts that transform the user requirements into a deployed software system. Again the figure that we see on this particular slide represents the software development methodology again we have the methodology phases, workflows, activities, tools, and artifacts. And of course, we make use of the requirements and as an output we get the software system.**
