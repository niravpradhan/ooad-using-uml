**Looking at the iterative and incremental, well iterative development focuses on growing the system in small incremental and planned steps. Of course here are the key ingredients for iterative development. Well we should say first that each iteration includes a complete Object Oriented Software Development life cycle including analysis, design, implementation, and test. And of course models and software are built incrementally over multiple iterations. Incrementally over multiple iterations and the maintenance is simply another iteration again or a series of iterations in this particular case.**
