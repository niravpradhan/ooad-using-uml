**Now looking at the Project Glossary. Well a process of identifying candidate key abstractions is also a good opportunity to verify that your project glossary is up-to-date. We need to verify that all domains-specific terms have been listed and defined, and of course identify synonyms in the project glossary and select a primary term to use throughout the documentation and source code.**
