**Continuing with the candidate abstractions or identifying the candidate abstractions. Here are few excerpts from the Hotel System artifacts, with the nouns marked in bold. Again, this would be an easy technique to scan the use case form for nouns that no later on would be selected as of course classes. Well from the Create Reservation Use Case Form Description section, we know that the Customer request reservation for hotel rooms for a date range. If all of the requested rooms are available, the price is calculated and offered to the Customer. If details of the customer and payment guarantee are provided, the reservation will be confirmed to the customer. So the customer enters types of rooms, arrival date, and departure date. Systems creates again reservation and reserves rooms. System calculates quoted price. System recalls quoted price. System notifies Customer of reservation details (including rooms and price) Customer accepts rooms offered. Extension Point would be for new customer. Extension Point for payment guarantee. System changes reservation status to confirm. System notifies Customer of confirmed reservation details. Customer can enter duration instead of departure date. Again, failed date check the Business Rule 1. Notify error to Customer. Complying with Business Rule 2, System determines that required rooms are not available. System upgrades one or more room types. No further upgrades available. Notify message to Customer Rooms offered are declined. Customer already exists. Customer enters customer name and zip code. System searches for matching customers, notifies Customers of matching customers, Customer selects correct customer deleted, Payment guarantee fails. Notify message to Customer. Existing customer not found. Reservation not confirmed, reservation deleted. The arrival date must not be before the again todayâ€™s date and of course the departure date must be after the arrival date reservations with assigned rooms must again but no payment guarantee have a status of help, and reservation with the status of confirmed must be linked to a payment guarantee and a customer reservation must not exist without been linked to at least one room.**
