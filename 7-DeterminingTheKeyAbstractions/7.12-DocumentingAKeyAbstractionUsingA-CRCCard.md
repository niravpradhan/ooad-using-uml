# 7.12 - Documenting a Key Abstraction Using a CRC Card

**Now we are ready to actually work with the key abstraction candidates to actually identify these key abstraction candidates making use of the CRC card. And on this current slide we see a CRC card that again represent first split into three parts, the top one represents the class name, the left part represents Responsibilities and the right part represents Collaborators. Let us go and apply this for the reservation. If you applied for the reservation, we can see that for responsibilities we can see that reservation reserves a room and then so that could be for example an operation or a method. And then for the attributes we have the status which is either new, held or confirmed, the arrival date, the departure date plus we found out that actually this reservation collaborates with a bunch of collaborators, which are room because we got reservation for room, we reserve the room. And of course the reservation is made for customer. And of course there is a payment guarantee for the reservation. So we can see that just based on the CRC that actually reservation is a good key abstraction and actually it can now be represented as a class within of course the domain model.**
