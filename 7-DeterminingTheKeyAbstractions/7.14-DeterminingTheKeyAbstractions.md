**After looking at determining the key abstractions where we introduced key abstractions, we also identified candidate key abstractions. We also discovered key abstractions using the CRC analysis which is the class responsibilities and collaborators analysis. We also created key abstraction forms and we updated the candidate key abstractions form. Let us go ahead and look at an example that illustrates the features and concepts that we learned from this particular module. So again looking at the application that we have been using, we are going to find candidate key abstractions from the hotel systems artifacts that we have seen. So again looking at the Candidate Classes Form that we see on this current slide, we see the Candidate Class Objects that we see in this case or particularly the candidate key abstractions are customer who is an Actor, Hotel, Reservation, Room, Payment Guarantee, Room Key, Room Phone, Bill, Chargeable Item, Receptionist, System, Rooms Upgrade, Assigned Rooms, Reservation Number, Custom and Number, Room ID, Room Types, Dates of Stay, Price, Checking Status, Room Occupied Status, Quoted Charge and again Additional Chargeable Items Allowed Status, Initial Room Charge, Chargeable Item Type, Customer Basic Rate, and Promotion. So we actually went through CRC analysis during the lecture again by trying to make use of that CRC analysis to identify these key abstraction candidates and see which ones are acceptable and which were are not? So based on this we said in addition to the CRC analysis, we can also use a little bit of intuition or what we call common sense. And looking at the second are the next again a slide in this case which is the second form and we will see now that we typically update the Candidate Classes Form by again selecting the class names that are acceptable and of course putting the reasons why we eliminated some of these. So for example the first one which is the Customer (actor), we decided to eliminate this because in this case it is an actor. The Hotel it turn out that actually its property, so it selected as a property, because a Hotel and the property and they are kind of synonym and of course Reservation is accepted, the Room is also accepted, the Payment Guarantee is accepted. Again all these accepted key abstractions themselves are actually have responsibilities and of course we discover that they also collaborate with other classes. Room Key that is external, Room Phone that is external. So again we eliminate that. The Bill it is a selective class name definitely and the Chargeable Item that is also another selected item. On the other hand the Receptionist, System, Rooms Upgrade, Assign Rooms, Reservation Number, Customer Name, again Room Id all these are rejected. And of course for Receptionist that is an actor, System would be the System, Rooms Upgrade that would be a reassignment of rooms, Assigned Rooms that would be an assignment of room, Reservation Number that is an attribute of Reservation, Customer Name that is an attribute of Customer and Room Id that is an attribute of Room. Continuing with the list and now let us take a look our Room Type that is what we are selecting. Again Dates of Stay that is a synonym for Arrival Date and Departure Date, so then in this case we should eliminate it. Price plus synonym for Quoted Price, Check-In Status that is an attribute of Reservation. Room Occupied Status that is an attribute of Room, Quoted Charge that is an attribute of Reservation. Continuing with the list, let us look at the Additional Chargeable Items Allowed Status that is an attribute of Bill, Initial Room Charge that again the synonym for Chargeable Item. Chargeable Item Type that is actually worth having. Customer that is also worth having as a class. Basic and we also discovered that Reservation collaborates with Customer when we were doing the lecture over this particular module. Basic Rate, again that is an attribute of Rule Type, and Promotion that is also worth having as a class. So in this case, what we have done is we looked at the list of key abstractions and then using some common sense and intuitions and of course the CRC analysis, we selected the ones that it should actually play the role of classes in the domain model, or the class diagram and the ones that should not be selected due to the fact that may be they are just attributes some classes or may be their external systems and so forth.**
