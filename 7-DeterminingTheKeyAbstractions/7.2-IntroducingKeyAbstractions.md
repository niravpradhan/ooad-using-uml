# 7.2 - Introducing Key Abstractions

<img src="/images/07_02_01.jpg" width="800" height="500">

**Let us introduce key abstractions. Well key abstraction is a class or object that forms part of the vocabulary of the problem domain. Again this is a definition by Booch. The abstractions is the name of the primary objects within the system. These represent an integral part of the language in which the domain experts and the end-users communicate about the business. Determining the key abstractions for a domain again is a process of discovery. First, we identify all candidate key abstractions by listing all nouns from the project artifacts in a Candidate Key Abstraction Form and then use the CRC analysis to determine the essential set of the key abstractions. Again, key abstractions are recognized as objects that have responsibilities and are used by other objects which are the collaborators.**
