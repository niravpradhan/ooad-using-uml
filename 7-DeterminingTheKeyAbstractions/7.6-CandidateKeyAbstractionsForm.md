**Looking now at Candidate Key Abstraction Form. Well a form for recording candidate key abstraction users three fields. First the candidate key abstraction. This field contains a noun discovered from the project artifact. Second one is the Reason for Elimination. This field again is left blank if the current date becomes a key abstraction; otherwise this field contains the reason why the candidate was rejected. And the selected name, this field contains the name of the class if this entry is selected as a key abstraction. So first we start with a list of all the key abstraction candidates and as we see here, so we have the whole list Reservation, Customer actor, System, Customer Room, Date Range, Price, Customer Details, etc.**
