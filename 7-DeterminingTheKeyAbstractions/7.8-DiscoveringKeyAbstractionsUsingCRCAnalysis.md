**Let us look now at Discovering Key Abstractions Using CRC Analysis. Well after you have a complete list of candidate key abstractions, you need to filter this list to determine the essential set of key abstractions. Again One technique that we can use here is called the CRC which stands for Class Responsibility and Collaboration Analysis. Well to perform the CRC, first we select one candidate key abstraction, then identify use case in which this candidate is prominent. Then scan the use case forms and the use case scenarios that contain this noun to determine responsibilities and collaborators and scan the Glossary of terms for all references to the noun. After that, document these key abstractions with the CRC card and update Candidate Key Abstraction Form based on your findings. Again the process in this case is iterative.**
