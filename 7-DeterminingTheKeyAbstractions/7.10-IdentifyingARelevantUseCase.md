**Let us look now at Identifying a Relevant Use Case. Well to determine to whether the candidate key abstraction is a real key abstraction, we must determine if the candidate has many responsibilities and collaborators. So to identify a case that might declare a candidateâ€™s responsibilities and collaborators, we need to scan the use case names for the candidate key abstraction, scan the use case forms for the candidate key abstraction, and scan the use case scenarios for the candidate key abstraction. We need to also identify the text of the use case scenarios to see if the candidate key abstraction is of course mentioned. So as mentioned previously there are three use cases that focus on the reservation key abstraction. They are Clear Reservation, Update Reservation, and Delete Reservation. These relevant use cases will be used to perform the next step in the CRC process in this case to discover the responsibilities and collaborations of the selected candidate key abstraction.**
