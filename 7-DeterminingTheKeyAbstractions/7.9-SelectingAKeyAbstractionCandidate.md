**So first we select a good key abstraction candidate is typically handed on in largely using intuition. Again, there are again few tactics that we can use and we can call them tactics or strategies. Again, these strategies can be asking a domain expert, choosing a candidate key abstraction that is used in the use case name and of course choosing a candidate key abstraction that is used in a use case form. So the noun for example you know if we take an example here the noun reservation appears many times in the following areas; Create Reservation, Update Reservation, Delete Reservation, in many places throughout the use case form. For example, the Check In Customer use case form, will describe assigning a Bill to a Reservation.**
