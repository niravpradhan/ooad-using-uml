**Now what we need to do next again going through all of these different candidates or candidate key abstractions. We need now to update the key abstractions form. So the candidate that we select that has responsibilities then we enter the name of the key abstraction from the CRC card into the selected name field. Otherwise, we enter an explanation why the candidate was not selected as a key abstraction. And we see it here on the next slide where now we see this form with again all the information needed. In this table, we have three different columns. The first one to the left represents the name of the Candidate Key Abstraction. The second column represents the reason why we are eliminating this candidate if we are eliminating the key abstraction. And the third column to the right represents the selected component. So reservation we see that is selected. Customer actor we know how the reason why we should not select it, it is an external to the system. System again is the whole system, so we do not use that customer yes, room yes, date rent that is synonym to the arrival date and departure date. Price is again synonym to the Quoted Prize. Customer Detail same as customer, Payment Guarantee that is a good one, Room Type that is a good one. Arrival Date, Departure Date, Quoted Price all these are attributes for reservation. Reservation Details same as reservation. Customer Name, Customer Zip Code these are attributes of the class customer. Today date external to the system, Period of Days synonym for duration.**
