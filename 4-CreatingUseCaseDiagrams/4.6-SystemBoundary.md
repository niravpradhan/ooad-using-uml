**Let us look now at the System Boundary. Well a Use Case diagram is usually shown with a system boundary. Again on this particular slide we see a couple of use cases where on the right side we see the equivalent use case diagram that shows the system boundary for clarity. In this case, the system boundary is represented by this square and its name is called Hotel Reservation System. On the left side, we see again the use case, but the system boundary box is now optional. It cannot actually we do not have to use it. In general, for clarity, we should use a system boundary when drawing a Use Case diagram.**
