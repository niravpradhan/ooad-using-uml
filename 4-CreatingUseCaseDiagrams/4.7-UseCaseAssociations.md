# 4.7 - Use Case Associations

<img src="/images/04_07_01.jpg" width="800" height="500">

**Let us look now at the Use Case Associations. Well a use case association represents the participation of an actor in a use case. Again, in the Hotel Reservation System, a receptionist role uses the system to perform the Check In Customer use case. And we can see the association between the Receptionist Actor and the use case which is called in this case Check In Customer. So of course, like we said an actor must be associated with one or more use cases and a use case must be associated with one or more actors. So an association is represented by a solid line with no arrowheads. However some UML tools use arrows by default.**
