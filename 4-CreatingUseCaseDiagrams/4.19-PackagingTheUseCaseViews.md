**Let us look at now Packaging the Use Cases Views. Again, it should be apparent for any non-trivial software development, again it would need more use cases than could be viewed at one time. Therefore, again in this case you need to be able to manage this complexity. Again, one way of managing this complexity is to breakdown the use cases into package views. Again, the figure that we see here on this particular slide show some of these packages again you could create in order to view subsets of the use cases and in this case, we see a package called Front Desk Use Case and other one called Reservation Use Cases and other One Called Maintenance Use Cases. And of course the fourth one called Marketing Use Cases. Again these can contain different other use cases like for example the Front Desk Use Case contain Check In Customer and Check Out customer. And the example of the Reservation Use Case contains Create Reservation, Identify Existing Customer, Perform Payment Transaction, Create Reservation, Delete Reservation, and Update Reservation. Again continuing with packaging the use case views, we can actually look inside every package to reveal the detailed contents. Of course, the use case element may exist in multiple packages where it participates in multiple views. The slide that we see or the current diagram that we see on this particular slide shows the use cases and an actor relevant for Marketing in this particular case. In this current slide, we have again continue with packaging the use case views we have an example where in this particular case the diagram shows some of the use cases and actors are relevant to reservations. And of course this would be an example of Reservation use cases and actors, where we have an actor called the Booking Agent that interacts with Create Reservation and Update Reservation, and Delete Reservation. And of course we have some extend and includes for example the Create Reservation interacts with Create Customer through an extend dependency. Of course like we can see the Create Reservation can actually interact with Perform Payment Transaction through an extend dependency. And we also can see how the Update Reservation interacts with identify existing reservation through the include dependency. Same thing for Delete Reservation interacts with the Identify Existing Reservation through the include dependency.**
