**Let us look now at Justifying the Need for a Use Case Diagram. Well there are few reasons why a Use Case diagram is necessary. One of them is that the use case diagram enables you to identify by modeling the high-level functional requirements that are required to satisfy each userâ€™s goals. So a Use Case diagram provides a visual representation of the high-level functional requirements and the Use Case diagram is often easier to model with the client-side stakeholders than the alternative textual presentation. Also the client-side stakeholders need a big picture view of the system. So Use Case diagram provides a high-level view of the entire system. Also the use case form the bases from which the details functional requirements are developed. Again, the use cases are the essential focus of the system development. And use cases can be prioritized and developed in order of priority. Again, use cases can be assigned priorities based on the business needs complexity and dependency on other use cases. And of course use cases often have minimal dependencies with which again enables a degree of independent development.**
