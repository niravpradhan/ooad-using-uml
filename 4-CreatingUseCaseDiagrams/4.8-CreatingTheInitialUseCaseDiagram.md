**Let us look now at Creating the Initial Use Case Diagram. Well one of the primary aims of the initial meeting with the projectâ€™s business owner is to identify the business significant use cases. Again, a use case diagram may be created during the meeting. Again, this may achieve faster and more accurate results by using the benefits of UML modeling to assist in identifying the major business oriented goals that the system will achieve. Of course, alternatively the diagrams can be created after the meeting from the textual nodes. The next couple of slides represent some text showing in abstract of the use case specific topics discussed during the meeting. The following text provides an abstract from the meeting with the business owner. Again, the purpose of this meeting is to create the initial use case diagram. Well the text says the booking agent internal staff must be able to manage reservations on behalf of customers who telephone or e-mail with reservation requests. The majority of these requests will make a new reservation, but occasionally they will need to amend or cancel reservation. The reservation holds one or more rooms of a room type for a single time period and must be guaranteed by either an electronic card payment or the receipt of the purchase order for a corporate customers and travel agents. Again this payment guarantees must be saved for future reference. The reservation can also be made electronically from the travel agent system and also by customers directly via the internet. Continuing with the text, the receptionist must be able to check in customers arriving at the hotel. This action will allocate one or more rooms of the requested type. In most cases, a further electronic card payment guarantee is required. Most receptionists will be trained to perform the booking agent tasks for customers who arrived without a booking or need to change a booking. Again, the marketing staff will need to manage promotions against special offers based on review of past and future reservation statistics. The marketing staff will elaborate on the detailed requirements in subsequent meeting. The management needs a daily status report, which needs to be produced when the hotel is quiet, this activity usually done at 3:00 a.m. in the morning. Well let us look now at you know the use case that we described. Again the initial Use Case diagram that represents the high level requirements that based on the text that I just read. Well we can see in this use case that the system boundary is called the Hotel: Initial Use Cases. Again, we have three types of actors, again rather four types of actors. We have got an actor device, which is travel agent system or it could be an Online Booker or could be a Booking Agent or could be a Receptionist. Again we see that the Travel Agent System or an Online Booker or the Booking Agent they all interact with the Manage Reservation use case. The Receptionist interacts with the Check In Customer use case. Also the Manage Reservation and the Check In Customer do also interact with the actor called Electronic Payment System. The Marketing actor interacts with the two use cases, which are the Manage Promotions and Retrieve Reservation Statistics. In the Nightly Report actor interacts with the use case called Generate Nightly Status Report.**
