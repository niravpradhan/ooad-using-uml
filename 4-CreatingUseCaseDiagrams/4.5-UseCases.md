**Let us look now at the Use Case themselves. Well a use case is the specification of a sequence of actions including variance that a system can perform. Again, use case describes an interaction between an actor and the system to achieve a goal. So use case typically encapsulates a major piece of system behavior with definable outcome. A use case again provides a visual encapsulation of all of the detailed actions invoked in major system behavior. The use case title provides a communication tool for stakeholders to discuss the system at a high level. Of course, the use case is represented as an oval with the use case title in the center. Again alternatively, the title can be placed under the oval. Again a good use case title should consist of a brief, but unambiguous web non pair and use case can often be a user interface independent.**
