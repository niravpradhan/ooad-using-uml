**Let us look now at expanding a high-level use case. Well typically managing an entity implies being able to create rather retrieve or update and delete an entity typically so called a CRUD operations. Again, other key words include Maintain and Process. Other high-level use cases can occur, identify these by analyzing the use case scenarios and look for significant divergent flows. Also if several scenarios have a different starting point these scenarios might represent different use cases. Again, be careful not to refine use cases too much because use case refinements can become an exercise in functional decomposition and can result in analysis paralysis. Now let us look at the diagram that resulted from the expended high-level use cases. So we see now that the booking agent does not you know interact with Manage Reservation any more, but now it become Create Reservation, Update Reservation, and Delete Reservation. And for the Receptionist now, again actually interacting with check-in the customer, and of course check-out a customer.**
