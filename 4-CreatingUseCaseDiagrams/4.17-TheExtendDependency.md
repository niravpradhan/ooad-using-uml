**Let us look now on The Extend Dependency. Well the extend dependency enables you to identify behaviors of the system that are not part of the primary flow but exist of course in alternate scenarios. Again this dependency is drawn like what we see here on the current slide, but the Librarian interacts with the use case which on the book. And of course we have here an extension points of a do book. So if the book is over do then in that case we need to extend it with the use case called Issue a Fine. Again, this dependency is drawn with the dependency arrow and of course and extend stereotype label and of course an additional label, that identifies the extension point. Continuing with the extend dependency again we need to identify and record behaviors associated with the alternate flow of a use case. For that we need to review the use case scenarios for significant and cohesive sequences of behavior and of course give this behavior a name and place it in the use case diagram with an extend dependency. We see an example of this on this current slide where a BookingAgent interacts with Create Reservation. And of course we have an extension points from which in this particular if the customer is new then in that case we will use the extend dependency to make the Clear Reservation rather use case interact with the Create Customer through the extend dependency. Well in this case if the customer does not exist then automatically we will go ahead and create that particular customer and of course create a profile for that particular customer.**
