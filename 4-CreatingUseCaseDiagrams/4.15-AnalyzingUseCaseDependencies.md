**Let us look now at Analyzing Use Case Dependencies. Well use cases can depend on other use cases in to a couple of ways. One use case includes a another use case i, this means that one use case a requires the behavior of the other use case i and always performs the included use case. For one use case e can extend another use case b, again this means that one use case e can optionally extend the behavior rather of the other use case b.**
