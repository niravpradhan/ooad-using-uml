**So in summary for this particular module we looked at a Use Case diagram that provides a visual representation of the big picture view of the system. We looked at the Use Case diagram that represents the actors that used the system again the use cases that provide a behavior with a definable goal of an actor and the associations between them. And we looked at Use Case diagrams that can be elaborated to show a software system based on the goals of the business owner and all of the other Stakeholders. In addition, we looked at Use Case diagrams that can be elaborated to show use case dependencies by using UML notation for extends, includes and generalization. And we finish by again looking at complex Use Case diagrams that can be broken down into views by again using UML packages.**
