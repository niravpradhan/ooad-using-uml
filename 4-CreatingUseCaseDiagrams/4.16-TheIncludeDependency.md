**Let us look now at The Include Dependency. Well, the include dependency enables you to identify behaviors of the system that are common to multiple use cases. Again this dependency is drawn with the dependency arrow and includes the include stereotype label like we see on this particular diagram on the current slide. Well in this case we have a Librarian that interact with the use cases, Check Out Book and Return Book. And then we see the include stereotype which again now represents in this case the relationship between the two use cases and of course identifying a book use case. So again, to identify common behavior we typically review the scenario of multiple use cases or common behaviors. So give again this behavior a name and place it in the use case diagram with an include dependency. Continuing with the include dependency again we need to identify and recall common behaviors, but typically we should review the use case scenarios for common behaviors. And like we said we given this again behavior a name and place it in the use case diagram with an include dependency like we see in this particular slide where the diagram shows our BookingAgent interacts with Update Reservation and Delete Reservation, and then we see now the dependency of those two on the use case called Identify Existing Reservation. Of course by making use of the include stereotype, continuing with the include dependency; we are identifying how the behavior associated with the secondary actor. Again, we review the use case scenario for a significant behavior that involves the secondary actor. In this particular case, we are making use of a receptionist that interacts with the CheckIn Customer and of course, that CheckIn Customer use case will of course interact with the actor Telephone System to enable the telephone for the customer. For that what we do it is we split the behavior that interacts with this secondary actor. Again we give this behavior use case title and place it in the use case diagram with an include dependency. And as we see here on this particular slide how the Receptionist now interacts with the CheckIn Customer and then between the CheckIn Customer and now this new again secondary title called Enable Room Phone use case of course where we specify here the interaction between the CheckIn Customer and the Enable Room Phone an include stereotype again to represent the dependency and of course that enable room will interact with the Telephone System.**
