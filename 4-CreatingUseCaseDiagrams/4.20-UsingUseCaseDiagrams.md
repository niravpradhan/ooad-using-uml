**After looking at creating use case diagrams, where we discussed the justifying the need for use case diagrams. We looked at identifying the elements of a use case diagram which are typically actors use cases system boundary and use case associations. We looked at creating the initial use case diagram. We also looked at identifying additional use cases. We are also looked at the use case elaboration where we analyze inheritance patterns and analyzed use case dependencies. And we also looked at packaging the use case views. Let us go ahead and look at examples that are actually will show us how can we can make use of the features that we learned in this particular module. And we first start by looking at the hotel reservation system. And in this case again here is an initial use cases of this particular system which is hotel reservation and we see again looking at the actors we see that we have Travel Agent System as an actor. We have the Online Booker that would be somebody connecting through the web, Booking Agent that typically receives a phone, call or an email to again handle the Manager Reservation. We have the Receptionist and we have the Waiter. Again, the Waiter add charge to the customer bill. We also on the right side, we see the Nightly Report then again that is a timely time trigger that happened at night generates the nightly status report. We have the Marketing folks that actually Manage Promotions and Retrieve Reservation Statistics. We have the Electronic Payment System that actually plays a role of an actor. We have the Telephone System that enable a phone in a room that is rented. We have again the daily trigger with the time trigger and of course we have the email system and that would again interact with the Generate Invoices. Let us look at some additional use cases and here is the next one that represents the Front Desk. Again, we can see how in this, the Hotel System and this would be the from desk use case where we see a Receptionist that can actually Register a Customer Loyalty Card, can Adjust Customer’s Bill, can Check In. Again and we see how the Check In makes use of include and extend dependencies. Again, the include would again move us to the Change Room Phone Status. And of course the extend here it Perform Payment Card Transactions. Also, we see how the Receptionist also can check out a customer again that check out has a bush of extends related to Perform Card Transactions and Perform Payment Cash Transaction of course Add Loyalty Points. We also see there are a couple of other actors that we see outside the Telephone System, the Loyalty Point System and of course the Electronic Payment System. Another use case related to Finance, we can actually see how the Night Auditor interacts with the Adjust Customer’s Bill and Generate Discrepancy Report. Again that is the part of the batch work. We also see another example of the Marketing use case where the Marketing actor here interacts with the Create Promotion, Modify Promotion, Retrieve Reservation Statistics, and Publish Special Promotion To Customers. Again when we see that also that use case interacts with the actor called the Email System. And the last slide that I want to show in this particular case is since we worked with packaging in the use case views, here is an example where we actually packaged the Marketing use case, the actors in now use case, the Front Desk use case, the Finance use case, the Housekeeping use case, and the Reservation Services use cases in all in packages. So for example the actors use case contains the different actors that we have that interact with our Hotel Reservation System, Booking Agent Daily Again Time Trigger, Electronic Payment System, Email System, Housekeeper, Loyalty Points, Marketing, and so forth. We also can see how the Marketing package contain the Create Promotion, Manage Promotion, Modify Promotion, Publish Special Promotion To Customers, Retrieve Reservation Statistics, and so forth. And the same thing with the Front Desk package and the Housekeeping package, the Reservation Service package and of course Finance package. So these are packages that again used to package the use case views and are all type of UML diagrams that actually we worked with throughout this particular course.**
