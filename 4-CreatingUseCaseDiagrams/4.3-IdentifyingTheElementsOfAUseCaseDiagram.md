**Let us look at Identifying the Elements of a Use Case diagram. Well a Use Case diagram shows the relationships between Actors and roles basically and the goals they wish to achieve. So a Use Case diagram provides a visual representation of the system. The use cases that the system provides and the Actors which pretty much represent the job roles that use again the system to perform specific functions. So again, a physical job title can assume multiple Actors or roles. Looking at the diagram that we see on this particular slide, we see an example of a Use Case diagram where in this case we have a couple of Actors, a BookingAgent, and the Receptionist. And again there is an association of the BookingAgent with the use case called Manage Reservation. And of course there is an association between the Receptionist and Check In Customer use case. And that we see that in this case, the system name is called the Hotel System and it has a boundary represented by the square. Continuing with the identifying the elements of a Use Case diagram, again the diagram illustrates the one that we see on this current slide, illustrates an alternate style that explicitly shows an association between the Receptionist Actor and the Manage Reservation use case. So in a sense that now we made the Actor Receptionist to actually interact with both use cases Manage Reservation and Check In Customer.**
