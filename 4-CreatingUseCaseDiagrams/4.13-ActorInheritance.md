**So looking now at the Actor Inheritance. Well an actor can inherit all of the use case associations from the parent actor. For example, the Gold Customer is a kind of a Standard Customer, but can access additional use cases. Again therefore, you can use actor inheritance to represent this relationship. And we see it on the diagram with the Gold Customer inherits from the Standard Customer. And of course this inheritance should be used only if you can apply the kind of rule between the actors. So in a sense now we can say the Gold Customer is a kind of Standard Customer.**
