**Let us look now at the Use Case Elaboration. Well during the meeting with the other stakeholders, you will discover many more use cases that you can add to the diagram. Again, you might also find that some use cases are too high-level. This is a use case again might describe a business function that includes several related workflows. Again for example, the Manage Reservation use case is too high level because it represents several different workflows that all deal with the hotel reservation. So the Manage Reservation then becomes the three different use cases which are Create Reservation, Update Reservation, and Delete Reservation.**
