**The next slide shows us an illustration of an example showing a possible refinement of the use case diagram for the Hotel Reservation System. Again, in this example we see that the Identify Existing Reservation by reservation number and Identify Existing Customer by customer details use cases. Again we will have different interactions with the actor, however if these differences are minor again there might no need to provide these two specifications use cases. And again we just see it here, we see how you know now in this particular case we have specialization of use cases.**
