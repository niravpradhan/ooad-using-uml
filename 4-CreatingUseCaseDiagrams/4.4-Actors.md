**Let us look now at Actors. well an actor is the role that a user plays with respect to the system. An actor models a type of role played by an entity that interacts with the subject. Example by exchanging signals and data, but which is external to the subject in a sense that an instance of an actor is not a part of the instance of its corresponding subject. Again, in this case actors may represent roles played by human users, external hardware or other subjects. And of course the actor can actually play the role of the primary or secondary role. For the primary role, it pretty much initiates and controls the whole use case. On the other hand, the secondary role it allows the actor to participate only for part of the use case. And of course a single physical instance of a human, a device, or a system may play the role of several different actors. Looking now at the different type of actors on this particular slide we see that again on the left side, we see an icon that represents a human actor, a user of the system. In the middle, we see the icon that represents any actor but again is usually used to represent external systems devices or time. And the one on the right again this represents a time trigger mechanism that activates a use case.**
