**Let us look now at Identifying Additional Use Cases. Well during the meeting with the business owner, you will typically discover 10-20% of the use cases needed for the system. Again during the meeting with the order stakeholders, you will discover many more use cases titles that you can add to the diagram. For example, maintain rooms that will be create, update, and delete, maintain room types there will be create, update, and delete. Continuing with identifying the additional use cases again the time of discovery depends upon the development process. So in a non-iterative process, you ideally need to discover all of the remaining use case titles bringing the total to 100 percent. However, this is a resource intensive task and is rarely completely accurate. Continuing with the identifying the additional use cases in an iterative incremental development process again an option is to typically discover a total of 80 percent of the use case titles in the next few iterations for 20 percent of the effort. Again, this is just of one of the many use cases of the 80-20 again the 80-20 rule. And of course we discover the remaining 20 percent of use case titles in the later iteration for minimal effort. Again this process works well with software that is built to accommodate change.**
