**Let's go ahead now and look at the steps to create a state machine diagram for a complex object. Creating a state machine diagram requires a deep understanding of the object that is modeled. Again this analysis is beyond the scope of this particular cpourse. You can use again, a bunch of steps, the following steps that we see on the current slide to simplify the creation of a state machine diagram after the states of the object are again understood. So the first one is withdraw the initial and final states of the object, step two, withdraw the stable states of the object. Three, we will specify the partial ordering of a stable states over the lifetime of the object. Number four, we specify the events that trigger the transitions between the states of the object, again, in this case, we specify transition actions if any and number five, we specify the actions within a state if any.**
