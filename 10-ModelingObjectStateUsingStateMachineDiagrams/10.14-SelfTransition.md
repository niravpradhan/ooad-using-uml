**Now, letâ€™s look at the self transition. What a self transition is a state transition with a same state for the source and the destination of the transition. As a result of a self transition, the exit and entry internal actions also fire. So, on the figure that we see on the current slide, it shows an example of the stack in which the push and pop trigger events transition to another state or transition back to the same state. So we see how we have a full and we have a partially filled and we have empty and of course we can transition from the partially filled to full and back and then we can transition from the partially filled to empty and back.**
