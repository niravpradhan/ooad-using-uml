**Let's look now at junction. When in UML a junction is used to simplify diagrams by breaking the transition into several fragments thereby reducing the duplication of trigger events, guards, and actions and on the figure that we see on the diagram, it shows the order of state transitions, order of events, and evaluation of guards and actions. So we see in this particular case, where the order of states and events, evaluation of guards, and actions. So for example for states sA, we can actually go to the state sC by following the event 1 and then we got the gm and go and then of course a3 , a5, and we can move from state a to state s, state sA to state sD, okay and that would be by following event 1, gm and gp, and a3 and a6 and we can also transition from state B or as sB through event 2, gm and go and going through a4 and a5 and that will lead us to the state C or sC. And we can also transition from state B or sB through event 2, gn and gp and a4 and of course a6, okay and that will lead us to the state sD.**
