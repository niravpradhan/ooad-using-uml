**Let's go ahead and identify the elements of a state machine diagram. So a state machine is a behavior that specifies the sequences of states that an object or an interaction goes through during its life in response to events together with its responses and actions. And a state machine diagram, which is pretty much the state machine diagram that represents the set of a states for an object or a class. Again the activities of a given state and the triggers that transition an object from one state to another. So, in this example, we have that we see of this current diagram, we have the example of the cooling system, where in this case, we see state nodes like cooling and heating and idle, we see the initial state, we see the final state, we also see the transition, and we also see the transition trigger, for example, here turn off unit, that would be transition trigger. In every state machine diagram must include initial and final state like we mentioned. These initial and final state nodes rather.**
