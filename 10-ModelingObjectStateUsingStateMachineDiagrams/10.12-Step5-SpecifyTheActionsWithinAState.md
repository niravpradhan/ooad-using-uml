**Now, let's go ahead and now go to the step number five. So in step number five, we specify the actions within a state. So in this case or this particular step, we specify an events and corresponding actions that occur within every state if any. For example, the cooling state indicates that the AC subsystem is turned on after the state is entered and the AC is turned off after the state is exited. So in this particular diagram, we actually now see the heating ventilation in AC system that includes the internal structure for the cooling state and the heating state, where we see what happened at the entry and what happened at the exit of every one of these states.**
