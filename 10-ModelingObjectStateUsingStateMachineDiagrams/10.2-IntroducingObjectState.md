**Let's go ahead and introduce object state. Well, a state is a mode or condition of being; again this is what the dictionary says. But, there are two ways to think about object state. A state of an object is specific collection of attribute values for the object. Again typically, people think of object state as the state of the attributes in an object. Again, this view is certainly valid, but it misses an important understanding about object behavior. So that is why we need to also say that a state of an object describes the behavior of the object relative to external stimuli. Again, this view is behavior focus rather than data focused and of course, in this particular module, we consider the second definition.**
