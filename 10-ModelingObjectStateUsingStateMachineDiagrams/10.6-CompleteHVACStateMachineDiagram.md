**Now, let's look at a complete state machine diagram for the heating, ventilation, and AC system. So in this particular case, we in addition to showing the states and the transition the different transitions from state to another one, we also see now the internal structure of the different state nodes. So, for example, in the cooling we have the entry turn on AC and exist turn off the AC, and the same in the heating state, we have the entry turn on the heater and the exit turn off the heater.**
