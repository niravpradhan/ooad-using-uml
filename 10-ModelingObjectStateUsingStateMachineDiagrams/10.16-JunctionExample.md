**Let's look now at a junction example. Well, the two examples that we see on this particular slide shows us the original state transition location that we have seen earlier and we also see so on the left side, we have the stack example without using a junction and then on the right side, we have the equivalent stack, but this time using a junction and we see the junction on the left side that pretty much shows us how, again, from the partially filled state can actually transition to the full state through the junction and we see the same example by going from the partially filled state going through a junction and transitioning to the empty state. So in this case, we see how the advantage of using a junction in which the number of duplicate trigger events and actions are reduced.**
