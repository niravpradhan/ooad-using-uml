**And here is an example of using a choice. So in this particular diagram we compare two examples of a stack. One example uses the junction state transition notation and the other example shows the differences by using a choice state transition notation and again this just to show us the difference between making use of a junction and making use of a choice. So, on the left side, we see an example using the junction again, the same stack example and in the right diagram, we see the equivalence stack example using a choice.**
