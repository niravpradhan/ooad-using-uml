**Let's go ahead and look now at the state transitions. Well, a state transition represents as change of state at runtime. Again, a state transition usually includes a trigger event declaring when an object changes from one state to another and in this particular example, we show the state transitions for a heating and ventilation system. Again this shows us how we can transition from the idle state to the cooling state, where we see a trigger event that says, when the real temperature is greater than or equal to the upper bound, again in this case and of course, we assume that the AC installed, then we turn on the fan and the cooling now we are in that transitioning from the idle state to the cooling state and then when the real temperature is less than or equal to the upper bound then we turn off the fan and that will transition from the cooling state to the idle state and then when the real temperature is less than the lower bound then and of course, the heater is installed then we turn on the fan for the heater and of course, we see here a guard condition and we see the actions. In this case, the guard condition is the heater installed and the action in this case is the turn on the fan and of course, that transition it from the idle to the heating state and of course, when the real temperature is greater than or equal to the upper bound then we turn off the fan and that transition from the heating state to the idle state.**
