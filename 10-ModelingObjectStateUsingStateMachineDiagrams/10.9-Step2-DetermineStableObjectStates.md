**Step two, we determine the stable object state. In this case, they are cooling, idle, and heating states. Again, a stable state is a set of conditions and behaviors in which an object can reside for a significant length of time. Again, a transition state is one in which the object upon entering immediately exits to some other state. Again, this should be typically called the transitory state or the transition state. Again, we should model transitory states if there is any significant behavior of the object during entry and exit.**
