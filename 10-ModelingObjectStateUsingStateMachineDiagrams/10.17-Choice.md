**Let's talk now about choice. When In, a choice is used to simplify diagrams by breaking the transition into several fragments thereby reducing the duplication of a trigger events, guards, and actions. Again, a choice also enables dynamic evaluation of the guards after the previous transition fragments actions are executed. Again in this particular example, on the diagram that we see, it shows the order of the state transition, order of events, evaluation of guards, and actions. So we can actually now see how we transition from again making use of a choice, transition from the state a to state c by going through event 1 gm a3 and go and then a5 that will lead us to the state c or going from state as a or state a through event 1 gm a3 and gp a6 that will lead us to or transition us to the state d and we can also see it for the state B or sB, where actually if you follow the event 2 gn and then a4 and going through go and the a5 will lead us to state C and or from the state B going through event 2 gn a4 and gp and a6 will lead us to the state D.**
