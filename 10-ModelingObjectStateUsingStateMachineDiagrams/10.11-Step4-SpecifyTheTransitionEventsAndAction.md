**Step four, we specify the transition events and actions. So, in this step, we specify the triggers, guard conditions, and actions if any for each transition. If no trigger is specified then the transition occurs immediately and less again it is guarded. If no guard condition is specified then the transition occurs when the trigger occurs. So the guard condition can actually halt a state transition even if the trigger occurs. So if no actions are specified then the transition occurs without affecting the object, in this case, other than changing the state. So if actions are specified then these actions act upon the object before the new state is entered and the diagram that we see on this slide illustrates the steps for the heating ventilation in AC state model.**
