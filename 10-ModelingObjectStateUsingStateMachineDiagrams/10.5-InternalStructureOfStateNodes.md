# 10.5 - Internal Structure of State Nodes

**Let's look at the internal structure of a state node. Again, state nodes represent a state of a single object at runtime. The internal structure of a state node can include specific actions to be taken in the case of object events that do not transition out of the given state. So, on the couple of diagrams that we see on this slide, we show the internal structure of a state node. So, we see that in this case, the types of events include entry, where it specifies actions upon entry into the state, and we have the exits which specifies actions upon exit from the state, and we have the do, which specifies ongoing actions. Again, you can also specify specific events with corresponding actions. So, the entry, exit, and do events are specified by the UML.**
