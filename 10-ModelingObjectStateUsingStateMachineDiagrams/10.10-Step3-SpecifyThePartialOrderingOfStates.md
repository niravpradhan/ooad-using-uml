**Let's go ahead and look at step three. Well, in step three, we will specify the partial ordering of states. Again in this case, we see how from the either state we can transition to cooling state and back and from the heating state we can transition to idle state and back and also from the start state we transit it to the idle state and from the idle state we can transition to the end state. So in this particular case, we actually covered all the partial ordering of states.**
