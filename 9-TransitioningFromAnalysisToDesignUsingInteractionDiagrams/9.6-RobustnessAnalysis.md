# 9.6 - Robustness Analysis

**And looking now at Robustness Analysis. Well the components identified during robustness analysis are called design components. Again robustness analysis is a process that consists in identifying design components that would be required in the Design Model. Again robustness analysis is the name given to the process that creates the Design Model. Again this name is not widely used in the industry but the process has deep roots starting with the Jacobsonâ€™s or Jacobson's Object Oriented Software Engineering methodology. So the diagram that we see on the current slide pretty much gives us a very nice idea about how robustness analysis helps us identify or build the Design Model. So looking at this diagram we see how we can look at robustness analysis as the arrow which is in orange in this particular slide represented in orange and then you would have as an input either Use Case Model could be Use Case Firms or Scenarios. And of course could be a Domain model or it could be a combination of any of these. And of course the output of that row that we see here the yellow one which is robustness analysis would be the Design model in this case we see a collaboration diagram or a communication diagram of a boundary components, service components, and of course entity components.**
