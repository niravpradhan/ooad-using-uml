**Now looking at Service Components. Well a service class or control class or component represents coordination, sequencing, transactions, and control of other objects and are often used to encapsulate control related to a specific use case. Again this is what Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh said. And looking at the Service Components, they usually coordinate control flow and they isolate any changes in workflow from the boundary and entity components. So again in this particular case we see how a booking agent interacts with the reservation user interface which is represented by the icon in the form of a circle with the T attached to it. And then that user as a Reservation User Interface now interacts with the reservation service which is represents with the icon which is a circle and on it we see an arrow. And again in this particular case we are invoking a method on that reservation service and that method is called make a reservation.**
