**Let us go ahead and look at Sequence Diagram Examples. Again the next slide or three slides will shows us three sequence diagrams that show a more detailed view of CreateReservation. The first one will focus on the primary successful scenario and of course a secondary unsuccessful scenario in one diagram using an alt fragment, and the second one we will see a secondary unsuccessful scenario where rooms offered are rejected by the booking agent, and the third one would be a fragment sequence diagram showing the final details for the get reservation detail fragment and includes a loop fragment. Again the final details have been or has been hidden in fragments.**
