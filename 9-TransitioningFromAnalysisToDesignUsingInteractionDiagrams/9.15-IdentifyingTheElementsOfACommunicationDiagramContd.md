**Again continuing with Identifying the Elements of a Communication Diagram, here is on this particular slide, another example of a variation of the previous Communication diagram that we have seen in the previous slide where in this case we actually see only the icons that represent the different components, in this case the boundary component, the service component, and the reservation component which is in this case an entity, And we will also see the message label, in this case make a reservation, create a reservation, and of course getReservationNumber, and return the reservation number back to the Reservation User Interface so that the booking agent can actually see it.**
