**After looking at transitioning from analysis to design using interaction diagrams where we introduced the Design model. We looked at the robustness analysis that helped us to create a design model, we looked at communication diagrams and their elements, we looked at creating communication diagrams, we also looked at sequence and diagrams and their elements, and we looked at creating sequence diagrams. Let us go ahead and look at an example that illustrates the features and concepts that we learned in this module. And we again on this current slide, we are looking at a communication diagram that we build from the CheckIn use-case form that we have seen earlier in one of the examples. Again, the idea here is by looking at the CheckIn use-case, we typically place the Actor for the use-case on the diagram in this case is the Receptionist. And then we identified then add boundary components, we identified an add control components or service components, we also identified an add entity components. And we see that the Receptionist now interacts with the CheckIn user interface, which is the boundary component, and that CheckIn user interface boundary components interacts with the ReservationService. Of course, the ReservationService here makes use of some entities and these are the Reservation entity component, the Room entity component, the Bill entity component, and the ChargeableItem entity component. Of course, we see also the different methods that are invoked from one collaborator to another collaborator. In this case, starting from the Receptionist moving through the CheckIn user interface to the ReservationService and of course, this ReservationService that makes use of the four different entities in this case which are the Reservation, the Room, the Bill, and the ChargeableItem. And in the next slide, we actually see this communication diagram that actually now converted to a sequence diagram. So we go by the same concept where we pretty much we will go ahead and again within the context of CheckIn use case form, we arrange in the components or the collaborators at the top of the sequence diagram in this case with Receptionist, CheckIn, ReservationService, Reservation room, Bill, and ChargeableItem. And then again, we will go ahead and see how add message links and activation bars for every message in the activity. And of course, we repeat those steps until we finish. We convert the communication diagram or the collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram. So we see how the Receptionist enters Reservation Number and then find the Reservation and of course, Reservation will be return and then of course, we can get the reservation details. Again, we can decide to accept the Rooms, accepts the CheckIn in this case where we again in this case we change the status to checkedIn. We can actually invoke the getRooms where that returns the room list and so forth. So we see the different again message links between the collaborator. We can also see the activation bars and we see how in some of these messages do have explicit return and some of them do have implicit return.**
