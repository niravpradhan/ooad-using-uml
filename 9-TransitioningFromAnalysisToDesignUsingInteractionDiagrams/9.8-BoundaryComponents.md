**Let us go ahead and look at what is a Boundary Component. Well a boundary class or a component is used to model interaction between the system and its actors. Again that is users and external systems; again this is by Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh. And by the way these boundary components can be abstracts of user interface screens, sensors, communication interfaces, and so on. And they are usually High-level User Interface components or they could be you know every boundary component that must be associated with at least one actor.**
