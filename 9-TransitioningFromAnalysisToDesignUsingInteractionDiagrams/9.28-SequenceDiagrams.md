**Now moving along and now let us go ahead and look at Sequence Diagrams. Again, Sequence Diagrams, they typically provide a different perspective on the interaction between objects. Again, they can be used instead of Communication diagrams. They can be converted to or from Communication diagrams and they prove to be more useful for developers.
