# 9.29 - Identifying the Elements of a Sequence Diagram

**So a Sequence diagram is a diagram that shows object interaction arranged in a Time sequence. Again a Sequence diagram represents the objects of a system and the Messages sent between objects organized in a Time ordered fashion. And the diagram that we see on this current slide shows an example of, you know, how Sequence diagrams are built. So looking at the collaborating objects, they are arranged along the top of the diagram again creating columns. Time is organized from the top to the bottom of the diagram and of course, here we see how Object nodes are nothing but the collaborators. We also see the Activation bar and we see also the message, which is in this case, like makeReservation. We see the Explicit return, which is returning an object of that reservation. We see an Implicit return where we do not see pretty much anything return. We also see the Lifeline and as we discuss we actually see how the Time again starts from the top and moves towards the bottom. And there every object again we see a dash line that indicates the duration or the life of the object. Again, if the object exists throughout the duration of the activity represented by the sequence diagram, then the lifeline should extend throughout the bottom of the diagram. In the Activation bar, like I mentioned indicates that the object is engaged in some activity. Again this usually occurs when a message is sent to the object. For example, the makeReservation message is sent to the ReservationService object and an Activation bar starts at the point where the message a row arrives at the object and extends again down in Time to the point when the ReservationService object has completed processing that particular message. Again a dash line we stick a row provides an explicit indication that a message returns a value. Alternatively, you can actually leave it out and the return a row in this case. In this case, again the end of the Activation bar indicates that the message processing is complete.**
