**Let us go ahead and identify the elements of a Communication diagram. Well a Communication diagram is composed of you know a bunch of different elements so on this current figure that we see on the slide, on the current slide, we see the Reservation user interface component that interacts or object that interacts with the Reservation Service and wish itself that reservation service rather interacts with the reservation. So we can see how from the Reservation User Interface, we can actually invoke makeReservation and so we have an Object node and we can also put in a Sequence Number like in this case 1.1, and the Message name is makeReservation. The Parameters in this case is the arrival date, departed date, and of course the type of the room for example and then we see the message direction. We also see a stereotype icon or a text in this case representing a service component. We also see in this case a create object stereotype, in this case we from the ReservationService we create an object called Reservation. And from the Reservation User Interface, we also see a get Reservation Number which pretty much returns an object in this case called a Reservation Number. So message arose showed the direction in which the objects collaborate. Again for example the row labeled 1.1 makeReservation indicate that the ReservationUserInterface object sends the make reservation message to the Reservation object.**
