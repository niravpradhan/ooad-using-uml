**So, looking at the Communication Diagram Example 1. We see again in this particular case how pretty much from a Booking Agent that interacts with the Reservation User Interface, which interacts with the ReservationService, which again interacts with the RoomService, and of course the Reservation. So, we see that in this particular case, we see the different methods invoked on the different components and of course at the end this would be a successful scenario. So we see how again the methods are labeled and of course the interaction of these different methods follow the sequence numbers from 1.x.whatever and then 2.x and of course that shows us the steps one by one how which method is invoked first and which one is next and so forth.**
