**Let us go ahead and introduce the Design Model. When a Design Model is created from the functional requirements of the Requirements Model. Again the Design Model is a realization of a use case. It describes the types of components required to perform the use case because the Design Model is merged with the Architecture Model to produce the solution as we see on this current diagram where the Architecture Model focuses on the non-functional requirements and the Design Model focuses on the functional requirements and when we merge them we actually get the Solution Model.**
