**Now moving along and lets go ahead and look now at the Fragments. So Sequence diagram support a Fragment notation. Again the uses of fragments include showing a sequence loops, showing an alternative path, allowing two or more scenarios to be shown on one diagram, showing a reference to another detailed Sequence diagram fragment, and allowing you to break up a large diagram into several smaller diagrams. Again the next slides will show us examples of the fragment notation.**
