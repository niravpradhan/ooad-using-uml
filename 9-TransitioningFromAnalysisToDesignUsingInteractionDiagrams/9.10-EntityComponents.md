**Now looking at Entity Components. Well an entity class or a component is used to model information that is long-lived and often persistent. Again this is what Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh said and the entities typically usually correspond to domain objects. They are actually instances of the domain model and most entities of course are persistent in the sense they can be persistent in a database and entities can have complex behavior. So from this description again we might think that entities only exist to hold attributes, however, entities can have complex behavior. There is a trade off between putting this behavior in a service component or in the entity component. Again a general guideline is that if the behavior involves the interaction of multiple entities then it should probably be in the service component.**
