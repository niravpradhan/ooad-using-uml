**Now Comparing Analysis and Design. Well analysis typically helps us model what is known about a business process that the system must report. Usually from the analysis we end up getting use cases or use case diagrams and Domain models. And again use case diagrams they represent the behavior of the system relative to the user and the Domain model represents the entities involved in the business processes. On the other hand, the design helps us model how the system will support the business processes. Again the Design model consists of boundary components which are user interface components. These components interact directly with the user. Service components again that perform business operations and use case workflow management. And entity components again that correspond to entities in the Domain model.**
