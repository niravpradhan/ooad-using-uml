**The next slide represents a Fragment Sequence diagram that is referenced from both the previous slides. It shows the final details of the get reservation details fragment and includes a loop fragment. So we see how, now we see a little bit more details where again we invoke getRooms on the ReservationService, returns a room list, and then below within the loop we have the getRoomType, the getRoomIdentity again, which returns the roomIdentity, and getTypeDescription, which returns the type and of course, getQuotedprice, which returns the Quotedprice.**
