**So let us go ahead and look at the steps to actually create a Communication diagram. Well we first should place step 1 we should place the actor in the communication diagram. Step 2, we analyze the Use Case from again form or the Activity diagram for the use case or maybe the scenario and for every action in the use case we should go ahead and identify an @boundary component, identify an @service component, identify an @entity component. And of course identify an add further Method interactions in our case here discovering new methods; Boundary, service, and Entity components. So the idea here is to identify an add any further interactions. Again by either discovering like I mentioned new methods; Boundaries, Service, and Entity component.**
