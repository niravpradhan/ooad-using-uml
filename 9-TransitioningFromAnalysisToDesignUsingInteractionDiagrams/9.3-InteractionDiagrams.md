**Looking at Interaction Diagrams. Well UML Interaction Diagrams are the collective name for the diagrams unlike Sequence diagrams and Communication diagrams which by the way sometimes called Collaboration diagrams. The Interaction Overview diagrams still represent the Interaction diagrams and these are a combination of Activity diagram and Sequence diagram fragments and again in our particular case the Interaction diagram highlights the which of the object interacts and then what messages are communicated between objects and the sequence of the interactions.**
