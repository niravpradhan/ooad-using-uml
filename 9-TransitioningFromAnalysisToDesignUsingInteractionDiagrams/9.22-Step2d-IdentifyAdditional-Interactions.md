**And Step 2d, we Identify Additional Interactions. So in this case, the makeReservation method uses the findRoom method to find rooms of the required type. After finding and choosing free rooms again not shown in the setRooms method assigns the rooms to the reservation. Again the calculator price which is not shown here is assigned to the reservation and we can actually see this through the communication diagram that we see on this slide. And we see how we have 1 and 1.1, 1.1.2 which is findRooms again invoked from the ReservationService on the RoomService and then we have the 1.1.1 which creates a Reservation. We have the 1.1.again in this 4 set the room and it was setRooms method, and then 1.1. again 6 which is set the QuotedPrice. Again the steps 1.1.2, 1.1.3, and 1.1.5 have been omitted in this particular diagram.**
