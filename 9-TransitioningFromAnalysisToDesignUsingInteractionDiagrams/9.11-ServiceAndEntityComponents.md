**Moving along and now let us look at Services and Entity Components. So an Entity component will often have a corresponding Service component. Again every service object will often control its corresponding entity object. And one service object can delegate control to another more coherent service object. So in this particular diagram that we see on the slide we see how a BookingAgent from the BookingAgent that interacts with the ReservationService through the ReservationUserInterface and that ReservationService actually now delegates some of its work to the RoomService. In this case for example, if you find with the ReservationService invokes a method called find rooms on the room service and of course the room service will go ahead and provide the available rooms. Of course the Reservation Server also service rather creates in this case a reservation, so it sets the rooms and set the quoted price and that is all will be put in the Entity component called Reservation.**
