**Now let us go ahead and describe the robustness analysis process. Well the robustness analysis process typically follow the steps that we see on this current slide. Step 1, we select the use case. Again robustness analysis is driven by a use case, so we select a single use case to develop into a Design model. Step 2, we construct a Communication Diagram or a Sequence diagram that satisfies the activities of the use case. And again using the use case Activity diagrams or Scenarios, we analyze every action in the activity diagram and perform again a bunch of steps in this case, we identify the design components that support the activities of the use case, and then we drove the associations between these components, and by identifying the associations between components to perform the action described in the activity diagram, and then after that we labeled the associations with messages. Again in this case, we create labels on the associations to describe the messages sent between components for performing again the actions and then step 3 in this case we convert the communication diagram into a sequence diagram or vice-versa for again an alternate view. So again this step pretty much enables us to transform the Communication diagram into a Sequence diagram which provides a time ordered view of the messages between the collaborate or collaborators in this case or the collaborating objects.**
