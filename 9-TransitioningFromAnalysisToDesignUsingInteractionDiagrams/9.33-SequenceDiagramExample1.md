**So let us start with the first one and the first one like we mentioned, it shows the primary successful scenario and the secondary unsuccessful scenario in one diagram using an alt fragment. So again following this diagram, we see the collaborators on the top, which is a Booking Agent, a Reservation User Interface, a ReservationService, a RoomService, of course a Room. We have reservation too and then we see the different messages going from starting from the Booking Agent moving all the way towards again reservation a room and below under the alt, we see again, the Payment Guarantee and we see the confirmation reservation. And of course, we see the Conformation Reservation Details, and we see also the no Payment Guarantee, which is in this case, if there is no Payment Guarantee then automatically we will destroy the, we will cause the Reservation to be destroyed.**
