**Moving along and now let us go ahead and look at Identifying the Elements of a Communication Diagram. So a message can actually indicate either a message name or a direction arrow. Again a solid arrow ahead is synchronous message and then open arrow head is an synchronous message. We have a sequence number describing the order of the message and we have a list of parameters passed to the receiving object. We have a guard condition indicating a condition and message and we have a return parameter in this case would be any type of parameter that is returned from a particular object.**
