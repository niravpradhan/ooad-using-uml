**So looking at the Activities and Artifacts of the Requirements Analysis Workflow, we see now after again you know gathering all the requirements. Now we look at analyzing the use case scenarios to define use case forms and diagrams and we see that again as an artifact. Then after that we create graphical views of the use cases, however the use case flows and business processes that could be related to activity diagrams. Then after that we determine the key abstraction using the CRC analysis. Again, CRC analysis stands for class responsibility and collaborations. Then after that we represent the relationship of the key abstractions in a domain model and of course verify the domain model using the object diagrams from the use case scenarios.**
