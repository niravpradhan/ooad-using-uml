**Now looking at UML Tools. Well UML itself is a tool; you can actually create UML diagrams on paper, on white boards, on flipchart sized plastic sheets. Again we have statically chart, again that will adhere to most surfaces and can be written on using white board markers. For example, you can create models by drawing on any type of piece of paper and have team meetings to collaborate on a class diagram on again a conference room white board or paper you know the walls and windows of a room with numerous plastic sheets draw on these sheets and so forth. So again looking at the UML tools and usually we have UML tools that again are available to provide a computer either drawing of UML diagrams for example the UML modeling tool may prohibit you from placing an actor node in an object diagram. Again, this verification is accomplished by restricting the drawing operations of the UML tool by again the syntactic constraints of the UML specification. Also these UML modeling tools support and enforce semantic verification of diagrams. Again for example, a UML modeling tools will maintain a semantic connection between a class called, for example XYZ in one class diagram, and the same at XYZ class in a component diagram. Also UML tools again provides support for a specific methodology. For example the rational software modeler and rational software architect including UML tools that supports the rational unified process would be you know an example of tools that actually again specify a specific or help or support a specific methodology. Again, this is a benefit if your team has chosen the methodology used by the tool that the team purchased; otherwise, the tool might be a liability. Also we should say that UML modeling tools generate code skeleton from the UML diagrams. Again, most of the UML tools can generate code skeleton for a variety of OO languages such as for example java and C++ and so forth. And also UML tools help us organize all the diagrams for a particular project and that is actually very useful, so keeping track of the multiple type of diagrams that we are using in a large software project can be actually a major task with ordinary drawing tools. So UML modeling tools provide the building support for maintenance of all these UML diagrams again for a particular project and some tools also provide building support for version control and UML tools also help us provide that automatic generation of modeling elements for design patterns. Again you know looking at the Java platform price edition components and so on thatâ€™s could be one example, so some of the UML tools actually provide advanced mechanisms that fill in template of design patterns and other framework such as the Java EE platform components such as EJBs and web components and so forth.**
