**The next slide shows us an example of Packages and Notes. Well a Package as we see on this current slide can contain any UML diagram from use cases to class diagrams to collaboration diagrams and so forth. And we see also an example of Notes, where in this case we have a class called Account and we are trying to put some notation or annotate the two methods create credit and debit. Well the credits means that we are adding an amount to the balance and the debit means that we are subtracting an amount from a balance.**
