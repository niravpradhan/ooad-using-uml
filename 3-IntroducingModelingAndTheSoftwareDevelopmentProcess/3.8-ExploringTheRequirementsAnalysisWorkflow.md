# 3.8 - Exploring the Requirements Analysis Workflow

**Now let us go ahead and look at the next workflow, which is the Requirement Gathering. So again, the purpose to determine what the system must do which you already have seen and the next one is the Requirements Analysis. So in the Requirements Analysis again there are two views of the requirements model created in the workflow. The completed use case forms, which again contain full details of the actorâ€™s interaction with the system and what the system does in response and the domain model, which is typically a class diagram of the key abstractions of the problem space. So looking at the requirement analysis, the purpose it pretty much modeling the existing business processes and for description it actually determines the detailed behavior of every use case. You got some supplementary use cases and of course the key abstractions that exists in the current increment of the problem domain. Again, those key abstractions later on can play the role of likely classes in the class diagram. And of course the business domain class diagram that of course will specify.**
