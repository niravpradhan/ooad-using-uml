**Now moving along and now again looking at the Activities and Artifacts of the Architecture Workflow. We see now that in the activity, we first select an architecture type for the system, then after that we create a detailed diagram for the architecturally significant use cases, then after that we refine the architecture model to satisfy all the non-functional requirements and we create the architecture baseline. And of course document the technology choices in the different tiers and layers and layer diagrams of course. In this particular case specifying the tiers and layer diagram that actually gives us the information that will include the lower level which is the hardware level to the OS level, to the mid lower level, to the spec level, and of course the different components that we use to built the application.**
