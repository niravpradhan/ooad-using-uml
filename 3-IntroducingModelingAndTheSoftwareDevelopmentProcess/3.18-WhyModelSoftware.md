**Now the next question is Why Model Software? Well from Booch UML user guide, we build models so that we can better understand the system we are developing. Again specifically modeling enable us to visualize new or existing systems, we know that models help understand conceptualize and visualize any kind of system, so you can model systems that already exist, for example the policies and procedures of a business form again an existing business process. So a use case diagram is used to capture the business system. Also in terms of modeling, it also enable us to communicate decisions to the project stakeholder. So again some models can be easily understood by the business owner, domain experts, and other client side stakeholders. Other models are more relevant to communication among development team members. Also modeling enables us to specify the structure which is the static part of it, static view, and the behavior which is the dynamic view elements of the system. So during the design and implementation workflows, the structural and dynamic aspects of the software system must be specified from the requirements model, again the solution model represents the complete conceptualization of the software system. And the UML provides various diagrams that support creating these types of views of the solution model. And we should also say that modeling enables us to again use a template for constructing these software solutions and the solution model is used as a template for implementing the code modules that makeup the software system.**
