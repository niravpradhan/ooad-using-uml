**Let us go and look at Exploring the Requirements Gathering Workflow. So the requirements of the system are divided into two functional groups: functional requirements and non-functional requirements. So the functional requirements describe the behavior of the system relative to the perspective of the actors that use the system. Again, high-level functional requirements are visualized using use cases. The non-functional requirements on the other hand they describe the quality of service of the system. Again, these requirements include characteristics like performance, throughput and so on. Now looking at workflow purpose and job roles, so the table that we see on the current slide shows us the description of the workflows. Again, the purpose of the requirement gathering workflow is to determine the requirements of the system by meeting the business owner and users of the proposed system. So looking at the table, we look at the workflow the Purpose and Description. Let us go ahead and start with the Requirements Gathering like we said the purpose is to determine what the system must do and then the description in this case determines which again with whom the system interacts. We are talking about actors in this case, what behavior which are typically called use cases that the system must support and the detailed behavior of the each every use case, which includes the low level functional requirements and of course the non-functional requirements.**
