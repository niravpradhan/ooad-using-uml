**Now let us go ahead and look at the workflows of the Object Oriented Software Development process. So workflows consist of activities performed by workers on the development team. Again there are many possible workflows, but again here in this particular course we focus on again the following seven artifacts or seven steps workflows. Let us look at the list of the workflows of the Object Oriented Software Development process. Workflows consist of activities performed by workers on the development team. Again, there are many possible workflows, but in this particular course, we are going to focus on the seven workflows that we see on this current slide. So the first one is the Requirements Gathering and that pretty much determines the requirements of the system by meeting the business owner and users of the proposed system. The next one will be the Requirements Analysis and sometimes is just called Analysis and that pretty much focuses on analyzing, refining, and modeling the requirements of the system. For the Architecture workflow, it typically identifies the risk or risks in the project and mitigate the risk by modeling the high level structure of the system. The Design workflow focuses on creating a solution model of the system that satisfies the system requirements. The Implementation workflow focuses on building the software components defined in the solution model. And in the Testing workflow, we typically focus on testing the implementation against the expectations defined in the requirements. And in the Deployment workflow we focus on the deployment again deploying the implementation into the product environment. Again, there is a single common goal that binds all of these workflows together. Again you know in our case to deploy and attest that software system that satisfies all the requirements defined by the business owner and users.**
