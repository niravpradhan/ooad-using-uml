**Now looking at the Objects Oriented Software Development as a model transformation. So looking at this current figure that we see on this current slide, it shows the few of the models that a development team might create. Again, the project starts as the mental models of the client side stakeholders. During the requirement gathering and analysis workflows the mental models are combined and transformed into requirements model. So the non-functional requirements of the requirements model are transformed in the architecture model which again defines the high-level structure of the software solution and the functional requirements of the requirements model are transformed into a design model, which again defines the abstract components of the software solution. So the design model is merged with the architecture model to produce the solution model which again defines the detailed structure of the software solution, so the solution model is used to guide the construction of the code for the again software solution.**
