**Now the next slide actually talks now about what UML is and what is not. Again, there are many misconceptions about UML. And on this particular slide we see the difference between what UML is not and what it is. So let us look at what is not. So we say that UML is not used to create an executable model. So models are not executables only working code is executable. On the other hand, UML can be used to generate code skeleton. Again, UML tools can generate the software skeletons from a model. There are attempts to produce executable UML in the future. Also we should say that UML is not a programming language. Again, it is a visual modeling language and on the other hand, UML actually maps to most all languages. So UML has features that enable a software designer to represent programming language constructs. Also we should say that UML is not a development process or a methodology so UML is simply a set of diagrams that can be used during the development process to model and document. Again it does not define a process that tells you when and how to build these diagrams. On the other hand, we can say that UML can be used as tool within the activities of a development process. Again, UML is a fundamental tool to several popular OO development processes including the unified process. Again UML can even be used if you do not use a formal development process.**
