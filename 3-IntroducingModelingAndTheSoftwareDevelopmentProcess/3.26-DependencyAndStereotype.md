**Here in next slide we see an example of Dependency and Stereotype. And again in this case we see how an example about you know looking at the stereotype where we see an account class and then we see the refinement of that account class by specifying the types of the attributes and of course the signatures of the methods and we see we define that with the stereotype called refines. And also this particular slide shows us also an example of a Web Browser depending on Web Server and the dependency stereotype showing the protocol to be either HTTP or the HTTPS.**
