# 3.3 - The OOSD Hierarchy

**Now in the next slide we see an illustration of the hierarchical relationship between Methodology/Phases, Workflows, Activities, and the Tools that create artifacts. So to support the activities the development team uses various tools to analyze, model, and construct the software solution. Again, these tools include word processors, the UML, the UML modeling tools, advanced text editors, and integrated development environments. Of course, an artifact produced in one activity might be an input into another activity, for example, a use case diagram, which pretty much described the intended behavior of the system is of course used during the design workflow to determine the software components needed to satisfy the functional requirements defined by the use case. And of course, artifacts are meant to be long lived, but again several Activities often produce short lived modeling artifacts that are discarded because the information gained is either documented as well more formally or is found to be of no value. And of course artifacts can be documents, diagrams and even a functioning systems. So the goal of software development is to produce a functioning system, again which is the final artifact that satisfies the requirements of the business owners, users, and other client side stakeholders. So again looking at this diagram we will see how you got your Methodology/Phases, above it you have your Workflows, then you have your Activities, and of course the Tools and Artifacts that the tools that you used to build your artifacts and of course your artifacts.**
