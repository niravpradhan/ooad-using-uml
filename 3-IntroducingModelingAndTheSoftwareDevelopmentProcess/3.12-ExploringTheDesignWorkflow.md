# 3.12 - Exploring the Design Workflow

**Again looking at now at the design workflow. Well you know in the design workflow actually we see that the purpose is to model how the system will support the use cases. Again whenever we see the word how it means the behavior. And again the design model for the use case is based on the class discovered or the classes discovered during analysis. Again, which are the business objects. By using interaction diagrams and state machine diagrams, we can actually explore the detailed object interactions and state transitions. Again doing this will enable us to discover new support classes as well as missing attributes and methods for the domain classes and of course, the design model again is then emerged with the architecture model. Again, this combined model is called the solution model to be able to represent a solution for our particular system. So again looking at the description on the current slide for the design workflow like we said we create a design model for the use case using interaction diagrams, and then of course after that, we identify a model objects with non-trivial states using the state machine diagrams, apply the design patterns of the design model, and of course create a solution modeling or model by again merging the design and the architecture model. Again and then after that we refine the domain model.**
