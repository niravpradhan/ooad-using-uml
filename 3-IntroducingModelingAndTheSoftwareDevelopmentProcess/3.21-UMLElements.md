**Now continuing with the UML, let us look now at the UML Elements. Of course, UML diagrams are built from modeling primitives or elements. Again, there are two broad categories of elements, Things also called nodes and Relationship also called links. So on the figure that we see here on this current slide, it shows many of the fundamental element a UML elements and of course we see an element like an actor, we see use case, we see classes and objects, we see components and hardware, we see states and activities, we see you know groups of things or what we call packages, we see our present Java code file or jar file, we see our present annotation, and of course on the right side diagram, we see Relationships like dependencies, association, canalizations, realizations, and so forth. And throughout this course, we will be introducing each UML diagram and all the elements that make up the different UML diagrams that we are going to see throughout this course.**
