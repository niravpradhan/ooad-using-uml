**And here in this diagram we pretty much show us how you know Activities and Artifacts Of The Requirement Gathering Workflow happens. So again in this case we will see that first we have you know the first step in the activity we have to meet business owners to identify a business oriented view of the requirements and that will again result in bunch of artifacts which are use cases and then again meet projects stakeholders to identify additional and refined requirements, again this would be refining our use cases. So moving along and by the way refining use cases can may be also involve the concept of use case scenarios and of course use case descriptions, which include functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Of course additional specification documents can include additional system wide non-functional requirements, project risks, project constraints, a business rational, or the purpose, future directions of the business, client site stakeholders, glossary of terms, and so forth.**
