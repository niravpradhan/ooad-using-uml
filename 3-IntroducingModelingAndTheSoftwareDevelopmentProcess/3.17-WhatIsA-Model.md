**And this lead us to the next question which is What is a Model? Well from Booch UML user guide a model is a simplification of reality. So you can think of a model in terms of traditional architecture. Again before constructing a building, an architect draws several different views of the building itself and the location of the building. Again, on the current figure of the current slide, it shows two diagrams from the same architecture plans for a library in Seattle. These different diagrams show different views. From architecture, you can actually learn that a model is an abstract conceptualization of some entity such as building or a system such as software. Again, model is abstract by its nature. Again, models can represent many different things both physical such as buildings and computer networks and of course conceptual such as software of course. And different views show the model from different perspectives. So an architect draws many diagrams showing different views or perspectives of the building. While views include floor plans, plumbing, electrical wiring, external construction, street plans and so on. And a software model can also be presented by different views and it will create diagrams for all these views.**
