**The UML diagrams that we have seen in the previous slide can actually be categorized into two main categories. The first one is called as Structural one and it shows the static structure of the objects in a system and is represented on the left side of this current slide. And the second one is called the Behavioral category and it shows the dynamic behavior of objects in the system. So the Structural category actually includes the Class diagram, the Object diagram, the Component diagram, the Deployment diagram, Composite Structure diagram, Package diagram, and Profile diagrams. On the other hand the Behavioral group includes the Use Case diagram, the Activity diagram, the Communication or collaboration diagram, the Sequence diagram, Interaction Overview diagram, State Machine diagram, and the Timing diagram.**
