**Let us go ahead now and describe the software team job roles. Again, the stakeholder in the project would be any person or group that has an interest in the project. Again, the set of stakeholders include Users and Managers on the Client-Side and the complete project team on the Development-Side. So looking at the diagram that we see on these current slide, we see on the Client-Side which is to the left we see the business owner and typically that the lead stakeholders on the client side of the project and this will be the person or the person responsible for making final decisions about the behavior of the system. Then we have Managers and Managers are the people that are the managers of internal Users. And then the Users are any person that will be using the proposed system. And again for internal systems these are usually employees of the client company. For example, a web based system this could be any Internet user. On the development side, we have a Project Manager and typically the Project Manager in our particular case they manage the software development project and this is usually not a technically manager. They manage the budget, resources, and the schedule of the project. Again, they are often the account managers for the client again if you are talking about consulting. Then we have the Business Analyst. These folks are the ones that gather requirements from the Client-Side stakeholders and analyzes the functional requirements by modeling the enduring business themes of the system. Again these are all is responsible for the business domain diagram, which of course include the use case diagrams and business domain class diagrams for example. The next ones are the Software Architect, again software architect defines the architecture of the system again least the development of the architecture baseline during the inception in elaboration phases and of course analyzes the non-functional requirements which are the quality of the services and of course identifies the projects risks and creates a risk mitigation plan. Then we have the Software Designers. Again, the Software Designer creates a solution model of the system based on the business domain diagrams within the framework of the architecture. And then we have the Software Programmers. Again, the Software Programmer typically implements the software solution, in many small development teams the programmer and designer roles are filled by the same person. And then below you see a couple of roles too one is the Software Tester. Those are again the folks that test the implementation to verify that the system meets the requirements. Again, both functional requirements which is the system is supposed to do for the user and again that user could be a human or another machine and the non-function requirements which are related to the quality of services. Again, this role might include the development team for unit and integration testing as well as the client side for quality assurance for acceptance testing. And then we have the Deployment Specialist. DEPLOYMENT SPECIALIST typically deploys the implementation on to the production platform. Again, this role might include several other job roles again could be system administrator, network administrator, script writer and so on. Again this role is performed by the development team during construction, but when the system goes to production this role should be filled by the client organization.**
