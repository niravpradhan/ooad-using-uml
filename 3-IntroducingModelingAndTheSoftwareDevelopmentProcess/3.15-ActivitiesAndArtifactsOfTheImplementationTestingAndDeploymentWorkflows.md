**Now looking at Activities and Artifacts of the Implementation, Testing, and Deployment Workflows as we see on these current slide within the activity diagram we see that the first activity would be to implement the software solution using the solution model. Of course, that will result in the implementation of the code. Then after that the next activity would be to test the software solution against the use case scenarios. And of course the next activity would be to deploy the software solution using the architecture deployment diagram.**
