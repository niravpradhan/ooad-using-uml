**Let us go ahead and look at Common UML Elements and Connectors. Well UML has a few elements and connectors that are common across UML diagrams. And these elements and connectors include Package, Note, Dependency, and Stereotypes. Well a Package is used to group together any UML elements and diagrams. Packages are elements therefore, they can be nested. And of course the Package in a logical view therefore an element might exist in more than one Package to form different views and Java technology packages are actually subset of UML packages. A note allows textual notes to be added to any aspect of a diagram. Again, this allows additional information in a form of text to be attached with that line to any UML element, for example, notes can annotate classes, methods, components, actors, and associations. Now dependency notation allows that when UML element depends on another UML element. Again, the type of Dependency can be attached to the line with a Stereotype. Well Stereotypes are used to specify a more specific type of element or connector types. Again, the notation for stereotypes is to bracket them between less than less than and greater than greater than notation.**
