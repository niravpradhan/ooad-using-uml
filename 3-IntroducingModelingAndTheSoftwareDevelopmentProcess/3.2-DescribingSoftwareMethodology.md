**So looking at again Describing Software Methodology. well a methodology is a body of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline. Again, this is if you want to look at the definition in the Webster dictionary. And over the history of the software industry there have been hundreds of methodologies developed. Again, the object-oriented methodologies incorporate object oriented concepts throughout the Object-Oriented Software Development process. Again, many modern OO methodologies compose the development process into large-scale phases such as inception, elaboration, construction, and transition. Again, these phases are composed of workflows, which are typically called disciplines and how these workflows are composed of specific activities. Again, these activities involve workers and artifacts. A worker is a person that performs the activity and an artifact is a tangible piece of information that is produced by an activity. Again, artifacts such as diagrams, documents, and the software cord itself are produced with tools. And of course the Unified Modeling Language is one of our most powerful tools for modeling software. So the final artifact would be a working software system that satisfies the initial artifacts which are typically the system requirements.**
