**Now looking at the UML Diagrams. On this current slide, we see again these UML diagrams enable us to create visualizations of our mental models of software systems. Again, these diagrams are used to construct many of the artifacts in the workflows described in this particular course. And if you take a look at this current slide, it shows that there are many different type of diagrams. Again, we see here about 14 of them and it shows the use case diagrams, which represent the set of high-level behaviors that a system must perform for a given actor. We can also see class diagrams that represent a collection of software classes and their entire relationships. We look at object diagram that represents a runtime snapshot of software objects and their entire relationships. We see communication diagrams and they are formally by the way called collaboration diagrams that represent a collection of objects that work together to support some system behavior. We see sequence diagram that represents a time oriented perspective of object communication. We see activity diagram that represents a flow of the activities that might be performed by either a system or an actor. We see a state machine diagram that represents a set of states that an object might experience and the triggers that transition the object from one state to another. We see a component diagram that represents a collection of physical software components and their interrelationships. We see a deployment diagram that represents a collection of components and shows how these are distributed across one or more hardware notes. We see a package diagram that represents a collection of other modeling elements and diagrams. We see an interaction overview diagram that represents a form of activity diagram where nodes can represent interaction diagram fragments. Again, these fragments are usually sequenced diagrams, fragments that can also be communication timing or interaction overview diagram fragments. We see a timing diagram that represents changes in a state or value. Again, it can also show time and duration constraints and interactions between time events. We see a composite structure diagram that represents the internal structure of a classifier usually in a form of parts and can include the interaction ports and interfaces and we see a profile diagram that might define additional diagram types or extend existing diagrams with additional notations.**
