**After looking at introducing modeling and the software development process, where we actually explore the objects-oriented software development process, we looked at the requirement gathering workflow, we looked at the requirement analysis workflow, we looked at the architecture workflow, we looked at the design workflow, we looked at the implementation, testing, and deployment workflows, we looked at again the benefits of modeling software. Let us go ahead and look at a Self-Check exercise and that again we remind us at what we have seen in this particular module. So we are asked to match the workflow with its description. Again, looking at the different definitions, we see that the first one which says the first definition says model the high-level of the structure of the system, paying particular attention to the non-functional requirements, and mitigation of risk. Again, by looking at this we see that this should map to the term Architecture. And the next one which installs the implementation into the production environment again this would be mapped to the term Deployment. The next one build and code the software components define in the solution module we see that this again maps to the term Implementation. And the next one which again says the definition says determines the requirements of the system by meeting the business owner and users of the proposed system. And we see that again this is mapped to the term Requirements or Requirements Gathering rather. And the next one that again definition says ensure the implementation meets the expectation defined in the requirements. And we see that this should actually map or maps to the term Testing. And then the next one that says create a solution module of the system that satisfies the functional requirements and we see that actually this maps to the term Design. And the last one again which says analyse refine and module the requirements of the system, we see that this actually should map to the term Requirements Analysis.**
