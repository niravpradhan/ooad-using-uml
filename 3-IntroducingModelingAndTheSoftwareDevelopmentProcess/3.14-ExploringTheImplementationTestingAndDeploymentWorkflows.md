**Let us go ahead and look now at the testing and deployment workflows. Well the purpose of the implementation workflow is to build the software components defined in the solution model. Of course, the implementation workflow is performed by the software programmer job role and the purpose of the testing workflow is to test the implementation against the expectations defined in the requirements. So the testing workflow is performed by the software tester job role and the purpose of the deployment workflow is to deploy the implementation into the production environment. So the deployment workflow is performed by the deployment specialist job role.**
