**And looking at the Activities and Artifacts of the Design Workflow, we see that within the activity diagrams. Now when we talk about the design workflow we will first create a design model for a use case using the Robustness analysis and that actually will lead us to creating what we called a collaboration diagram, sometimes also is called the communication diagram. We identify a model in the non-trivial object state using the state machine diagram that could be any type of state diagram that is needed for a particular algorithm that needs to be implemented, apply design patterns to the design model. Again, there are many design patterns that exists and we are going to look at some of them in this particular course and create the solution model by merging the design on the architecture model. And of course we refine the domain model to satisfy the solution model.**
