# 3.10 - Exploring the Architecture Workflow

**Now moving along and now what we are going to do is look at the architecture. So again looking at the architecture, we see now that the purpose is to model the high-level system structure to satisfy the non-functional requirements. Again the architectural workflow is rather complex and is beyond again the scope of this particular course. However, we still again see how the architecture model affects the design workflow. Again, from the perspective of the designer the architecture model provides a template of the high-level system structure into which the designer plugs in designed components. Of course in this case if we take a look at the description at the architecture workflow, we developed the highest level structure of the software solution, identify the technologies that will support the architectural model and elaborate the architecture model with architecture patterns to satisfy the non-functional requirements.**
