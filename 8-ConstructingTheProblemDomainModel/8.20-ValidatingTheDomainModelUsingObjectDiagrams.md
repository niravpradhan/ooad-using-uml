# 8.20 - Validating the Domain Model Using Object Diagrams

**Now let us go ahead and look at how we validate the Domain model using the Object diagram. So to validate the Domain model first we pick one or more use cases that exercise the Domain model and ideally we should create an Object diagram that represents scenarios for every use case. And the second one we pick one or more use case scenarios for the selected use cases. Again we should create Object diagrams that represent all scenarios for a given use case. Again pick scenarios that explore a variety of situations. You want to find scenarios that push the constraints of the Domain model, for example, here Create Reservation use case in our particular case here we should explore a scenario that is simple such as reserving one room and others that are more complex such as reserving multiple rooms. Step 3 we walk through every scenario separately and construct the objects without again with data mentioned in the scenario. Again because scenarios are specific, they include a lot of details. Again this detail is very useful in creating a scenario Object diagram and step number 4 we compare every Object diagram against the Domain model to see if any association constraints are violated so by comparing Object diagrams from a variety of use case scenarios again we will see if the Domain model has been incorrectly constrained.**
