**Now looking at Step 3, and in Step 3 again following the Clear Reservation Scenario 1, the system allocates the required number and type of rooms from the available rooms. The system responds that the specified rooms are available returns the provisional reservation number and marks the reservation as health and we see that in the reservation object where now the status is HELD and of course it is has changed to HELD and of course we see now a link between the object reservation and the Blue:Room object. So the booking agent in our case here found out that the Blue:Room is available and for so we can go ahead and change the status to HELD, so now the reservation is HELD.**
