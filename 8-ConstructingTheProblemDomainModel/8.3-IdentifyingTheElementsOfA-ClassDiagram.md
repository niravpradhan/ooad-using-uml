**Now let us look at Identifying the Elements of a Class Diagram. So a Class diagram in the UML is probably the most recognized. It is used to visually represented classes the members of the class and the relationships between classes, again, typically called Associations. And the diagram that we see on this current slide shows an example of class diagram with few of the features labeled by again call outs. So here we have the Class node, we have the Association between the two classes. For example, here is the Reservation and Room, we have the Multiplicity. And again it could be one-to-many or one. And again we have the Association name, for example, here between the Reservation and Room that is the Association name is reserved resource, and we have the role name here specified by the rooms, and of course, we also have the association between Reservation and Customer and that is again the name is made for, okay in a sense that Reservation is made for a Customer.**
