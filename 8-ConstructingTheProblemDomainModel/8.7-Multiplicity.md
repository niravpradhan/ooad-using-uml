**Now looking at Multiplicity, well multiplicity determines how many objects might participate in the relationships. Again the figure that you see on the slide shows an example of association with multiplicity label. Again this association would be read as a Reservation is made for one and only one Customer. Again reading it in the other direction would be a Customer can make one or more Reservations.**
