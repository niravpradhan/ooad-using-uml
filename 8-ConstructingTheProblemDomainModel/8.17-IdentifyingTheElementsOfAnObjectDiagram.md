**So moving along and let us go ahead and identify the elements of an object diagram. Well a static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram. It shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time. Again the object diagram in UML visually represent objects and their runtime links. Again the figure that we see here shows an example of an object diagram with few of the features labeled by call outs. In this case we have an Object node, Reservation. Again as we see it is represented with the word Reservation and in front of it there is a colon, and of course it is underlined and we have now a link between the Reservation object, and the Customer object, and again in this case would be an instance of Reservation, and an instance of the class Customer, and these are objects. So in this case when there is a link between the instance of Reservation and the instance of customer and that link in this case is labeled made for a Reservation instance of a Reservation is made for an instance of Customer. We also have a link between Reservation and Room again link names are usually ignored in object diagrams.**
