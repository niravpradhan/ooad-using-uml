**Links, so looking at links. Again in object diagrams every link is unique and is one to one with respect to the participants, so a link is unique instance of class association that means that every link connects only to object together. So there is no multiplicity on these links because everything is one to one because we are talking about objects here rather than classes. So for example on this diagram here the property object is associated with three different rooms and every association has its own association links. So for example here a Reservation can be associated with the Victoria:Room, Blue:Room, or Queen:Room. And again we are all have association with the Property object.**
