**Now Step 4 we are going to Label the Association Multiplicity. So in this case we see how we added the multiplicity labels to the associations. Again the multiplicity information is usually not identified during the CRC analysis. Again this information can be identified from the use case scenarios. Again the use case 4 model domain experts and so forth. So in this case we decided that one customer can have one or more reservations, and a room can have one or more reservations, and a property can have one or more rooms, and of course there is a one to one association between a Reservation and a Payment Guarantee which means here every Reservation has a Payment Guarantee.**
