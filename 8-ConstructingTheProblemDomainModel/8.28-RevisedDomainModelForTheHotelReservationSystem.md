**So, moving along, let us go ahead and look at, you know, again comparing the first scenario object diagram actually verifies the domain model, but the second scenario that we have seen identifies the problem with the Domain model. Why? Because, you know, if we take a look at the Reservation, it turned out that the Reservation has three different links with three different rooms; the Victoria:Room, Blue:Room, and the Queen:Room. So, in a sense, the second scenario shows the multiple rooms reserved for a single reservation. Therefore, the multiplicity label next to the room class must be changed. It used to be, you know, a one, but now in this case, it should be changed to 1..*, which is one-to-many and we can see that on this current diagram how actually that has changed from the comparing to the older domain model that we have seen. So, we found that there is a problem or there is a mistake in the multiplicity here particularly the one next to the room class.**
