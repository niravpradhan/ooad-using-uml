**Let us go ahead and look at Object Nodes. Well an object node usually includes some form of name and data type. So on this on this current slide we actually see some object node types. So we have an object name without a type and that is Victoria, we have an object type without a name that would be :Room and then underlined that would be an instance or an object of type Room and we have a type with a name. So in this case we have a Room called Blue which is an object of type room. So and also an object node might also include attributes and as an example we see here how the object of type customer has the attributes first name, last name, address, and phone number except that those attributes now take values. They actually have specific values to represent that particular instance of customer. In this case the first name is Jane, and the last name is Googol, the address is 2 Main street, and the phone number is 9995554747 which means those particular values of the different attributes that you we see on this current slide specify the special values for the attributes of the object of type customer in this case.**
