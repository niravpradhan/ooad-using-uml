**Now looking at Step number 5. In Step number 5 the booking agent performs a payment guarantee check. This guarantee check is successful; the system assigns the payment guarantee to the reservation and changes the status of the reservation to confirmed. Again we see that with the attributes status of the Reservation object where now the status has changed to CONFIRMED, so it moved from HELD to CONFIRMED. The system returns the reservation ID and the booking details which is in this case it is booked for Jane Google and the room that is going to be listed is the Blue:Room which is in the Property name called Santa Cruz, and of course it has a Payment Guarantee object that is now linked to the Reservation.**
