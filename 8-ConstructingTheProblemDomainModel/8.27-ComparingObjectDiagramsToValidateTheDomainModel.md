# 8.27 - Comparing Object Diagrams to Validate the Domain Model

**So Comparing the Object Diagrams to Validating the Domain Model. Again to validate the Domain model, we compare the class diagram with the scenario Object diagrams. Again in this case, Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. And we should be able to ask the following questions and see if we can answer them. So, the first one is, are there attributes or responsibilities mentioned in the scenario that are not listed in the Domain model? Again the data in the scenario should be reflected in some object of the scenario Object diagram. We should verify that the data attributes in the objects have corresponding data attributes in the class diagram. The second question is, are there associations in the Object diagram that do not exist in the Domain model? Again, every association in the scenario Object diagram must have a corresponding association in the Domain model. So, if we find an association that does not exist in the Domain model, ask the domain expert which diagram is correct and make the necessary changes to the inaccurate diagram. And of course the third question is, are there scenarios in which the multiplicity of a relationship is wrong? Again, for every Object diagram, count the number of associations for a given type of association and verify that this number is valid for the multiplicity constraints specified in the Domain model.**
