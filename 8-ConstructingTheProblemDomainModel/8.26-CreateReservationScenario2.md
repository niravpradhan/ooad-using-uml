**Let us look at Create Reservation Scenario number 2. So we have seen a walk through of a use case scenario to generate an Object diagram that was in the previous Scenario 1. Here is another scenario that has the actor making the reservation for a small family reunion in which three rooms are booked. Again, by comparing these two scenarios, we should be able to see how to validate the Domain model and of course find errors in the model if they exist.**
