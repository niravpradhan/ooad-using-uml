**Step 4 again of the same Scenario 1, the booking agent accepts the rooms offered in this case which is the Blue:Room, the booking agent selects that the Customer has visited one of the hotels in this group before and enters the zip code and customer name. The system finds and returns the list of matching customers with full address details, the booking agent selects one of the customers has been the valid customer and the system assigns this customer to the reservation so that is why now we see an instance of type customer. So that would be the object Customer and there is the link between the Reservation object and the Customer object. This particular customer has the first name Jane, the last name Googol, and the address 2 Main Street, and the phone number which is 9995554747.**
