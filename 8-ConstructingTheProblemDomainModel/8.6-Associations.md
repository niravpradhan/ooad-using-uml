**Now looking at Association, associations actually represent relationship between classes. And associations are manifested are runtime in which two objects are associated with each other usually with an object reference. So it is important to understand that Class Diagrams represents static information about the relationships between classes. A class diagram again does not represent the dynamic relationships of objects at runtime. It is better again to link or kind of think of a class diagram as a set of constraints on the dynamic runtime nature of objects. Again here we see the Relationships and Roles. So on this figure here we saw an example of association where this association would be again read as a Reservation is made for a Customer.**
