**Now looking at Association Classes. Well sometimes information is included in the association between two classes. For example, a Person works for many Employers. So if you need to again record details about each term of Employment this information belongs to the association between the Person and theEmployer. You can show this using an association class and the figure that we see on this slide shows us actually that where we see an Employer and a Person and as you see a Person an Employer can have one or more Persons and a Person can work for zero or more Employer, so we have the many-many. So in this we make use of the Employment association class that actually represents in this case the Start Date, the End Date, and the Salary for the particular Employment of the Person for a particular Employer of course. So in the Employment in this case is an association class that recalls the employment details for each term of Employment between a Person and an Employer.**
