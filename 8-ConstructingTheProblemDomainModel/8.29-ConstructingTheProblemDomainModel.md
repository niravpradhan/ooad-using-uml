**After looking at constructing the Problem Domain model where we introduced the Domain model, we identified the elements of a class diagram. We looked at creating a Domain model by again drawing the class nodes, drawing the associations, labeling the associations and role names of course, labeling the association multiplicity, and drawing the navigation arrows. And of course, after that we looked at identifying the elements of an Object diagram and validating the Domain model using Object diagrams. Let us go ahead and look at an example that illustrates the features and concepts that we learned in this particular module. And we look on this current slide, we look at the Domain model or the Class diagram that we had for the hotel system in the lecture. So we have again Class Reservation, Customer, Room Property, and Payment and of course, we looked at their associations and multiplicity and of course labeling the associations and so forth. And now what we want to do is how about if we want to actually expand this Domain model by again since we started with the simple one and we want to identify additional classes and see how they actually they all fit within a class diagram or a Domain model that will expend this existing Simple Class diagram or Domain model that we did for the Hotel system during the lecture. So we can actually look at again based on the previous example that we have seen, we identified a bunch of key abstractions that actually could play the role or should play the role of classes in the Domain model and what we want to do is use those key abstractions that were selected to actually expand the class diagram or the Domain model that we have seen in the previous slide. So we have a Reservation and again since we identified the Bill as a class so we can actually create an association between Reservation and the Bill, and you see that it has a relationship a one-to-one relationship between it and the Bill. We also found out that there is a PaymentGuarantee, so again we can say the Reservation Guarantee again by the PaymentGuarantee. And then, there is a one-to-one relationship between the Reservation and PaymentGuarantee class. And then also, we found out the Room actually Room type and it can be a class, and then in this case we actually have now an association between Room and RoomType. Again, the RoomType will contain the descriptions of the rooms. So again, we can say Room has RoomType. We also identified the ChargeableItem as a class and we can say that a Bill can actually have zero or more ChargeableItems and that is why we see an association between the Bill class and the ChargeableItems. In this case, its one-to-many association. We also found out that ChargeableItem type, it can be a class and in this case, we create an association between the ChargeableItem and the ChargeableItemType. Again, in this case, a ChargeableItem Type again has a one-to-many relationship with the ChargeableItem. We also found out that the PurchaseOrderGuarantee is also can be another class. So in this case, we actually decided to create the CarPaymentGuarantee and class and of course the PurchaseOrdersGuarantee class. We wanted them to inherit from the PaymentGuarantee. And we see the inheritance relationship between the PaymentGuarantee and the CarPaymentGuarantee, and of course, the PaymentGuarantee and the PurchaseOrderGuarantee. So in this case, the PaymentGuarantee would be the super class and the card PaymentGuarantee and the PurchaseOrderGuarantee are actually subclasses. We also used here a Company as a class and we created the relationship between the PurchaseOrderGuarantee and the Company. In this case, again Company has one-to-many relationship with the PurchaseOrderGuarantee. We also found out that the Promotion is a class and we now have a relationship or an association between the Property class and the Promotion. Again this is many-to-many, so between the many-to-many relationship between the Promotion class and the Property. And also, we have the SeasonalPriceAdjustment, which also can be a class. And again, we have an association between the Property and the SeasonalPriceAdjustment. So this actually diagram helps us to expand the previous class diagram that we have seen. Again all of this is based on the different key abstractions that we selected from the previous example that we have seen from the again the key abstraction form. Now the next slide actually represents a scenario where in this case we selected a bunch of objects and within a scenario to be able to again see how in this case an Object diagram helps us validate the class diagram. So in this case, we actually looked at the scenario where we assume that the date is December 23, 2009 and John Smith has not check-in yet. So in this case, we have a Reservation object and the Reservation object has a bunch of attributes with values like reservation number is 1346901 and arrival date is the 12/23/09, departure date is 12/27/09 and of course the status is confirmed and the quoted price is 800. Of course, there is a link between the Reservation object and Customer object. In this case, this Reservation is for the Customer John Smith. And of course, there is a link between the Reservation object and the CardPaymentGuarantee. In this case, we see that the current CardPaymentGuarantee amount is 800, and of course, the card number attribute is 5004123456789. We also see a link between the Reservation object and the Room object. In this case, the Room as we see the attribute the room id is 319 and the status is available. And we also make the Room object again linked to the RoomType and Property object. Again, in this case, for the RoomType the description is double room and we have a link between the RoomType and in this case another room, which is, in this case room id 309 the status is available. So in this case, we are looking at, there is no check-in yet, but we have two available rooms one is room id 319 and the other one is room id, which is 302. And as we see the two objects of the type room here with the ID 319 and 302 have actually links to the reservation. Of course, decision has to be made and let us assume that John Smith needs only one room and so a decision has to be made to actually decide if John Smith would go with room 319, which is available or room 302, which is also available. And we also see that these Room objects have links to the Property because they are located in the property.**
