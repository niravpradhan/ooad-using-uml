# 8.2 - Introducing the Domain Model

**Let us look at Introducing the Domain Model. Well a Domain model is a sea of classes in a system that serves to capture the vocabulary of the problem space; also known as a conceptual model. Again this is by Booch and the Domain model is one of the three major views of the requirement model. Again the others are the Use Case Model and the Supplementary Specification Document. So the classes in the Domain model are the systemâ€™s key abstractions. Again these are the ones that we discussed earlier in the previous module where we actually made use of the CRC to identify these key abstractions. And the Domain model shows relationships between the key abstractions which we typically call collaborators. Again the CRC analysis identified the classes which are the key abstractions and responsibilities and collaborations between classes.**
