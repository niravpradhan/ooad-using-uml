**Now in terms of the Class Node Compartments, well a class node maybe split into three or more compartments. Here we see here three different compartments with the top one represents the Name of the compartment, and the middle one represents the Attributes compartment that again recalls attributes of the class, and the one below or compartment below represents the Operations. In this case would be the functions or the methods. Again additional compartments maybe added if we want.**
