**Now let us look at Creating a Domain Model. Well starting with the key abstractions that we discovered in the previous module, we can actually create a Domain model again following the following steps that we see on this slide. First we draw the class node for each key abstraction and then list known attributes, list known operations. Then step 2 in this case, draw associations between collaborating classes, step 3 identifying document relationship and role names, step 4 identifying document association multiplicity, step 5 optionally identifying document association navigation.**
