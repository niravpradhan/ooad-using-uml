**The next step in this case would be to Label the Associations and Role names. So as you see now we have role names like Reservation, and cust for Customer, and Room, and Property, and so forth. And then we also now label the association. So in our case here the association between Reservation and Customer is made for and then we can see another example of the association between Reservation and Payment Guarantee where it says reservation guaranteed by payment guarantee and of course we have a room and just as an example and the room and the property have an association and is labeled as room located at property.**
