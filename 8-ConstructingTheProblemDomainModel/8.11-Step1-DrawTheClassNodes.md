**And here we see the following again the creating the domain model steps. Let us go ahead and use an example to actually create all of that. So first of all in again this example is related to the hotel reservation. So first of all we drew the class nodes again we brought these class nodes or we decided that these will represent class nodes based on the previous module; Reservation Customer Room, Payment Guarantee, and Property. Of course, we discovered that these are key abstractions that we should select. So first we will go ahead and draw these class nodes for each key abstraction and of course show the attributes and responsibilities for every single node. Here we have chosen to specify the ones of reservation and the attributes of customer.**
