# 8.15 - Step 5 - Draw the Navigation Arrows

**Step 5 now we Draw the Navigational Rows. So again in this case we just specify these navigations and again this is done only when a functional requirement constraints the domain model or when the business analyst decides that the navigation of a particular association is meaningless for the domain. Again for example it is not necessary to be able to navigate from a Room Object to a Reservation, so this association has navigation or row pointing from the Reservation to the Room class again but not in the other direction. We should notice also that the association between a room and a property has navigation row on both ends. Again this makes that association explicitly bidirectional, so association without navigational rows are typically implicitly bidirectional, for example between the Reservation and the Payment Guarantee that we see on this current diagram.**
