**Now looking at Class nodes. Well Class Nodes represent classes of objects within the model. Again class nodes can take many visual forms in UML, however, a class node is represented by a rectangle with a name of the class in a bold again non-space font. So here on this diagram that we see on this slide we have different ways to represent the class node. It could be just a rectangle with a name, could be for example in our case here we have the Customer and then represented by as an entity. We also see Customer and then we represent it with the icon which is a circle of align and we all we can represent it just as a circle over a line. Again a class node can represent conceptual entities such as key abstractions and during the analysis work flow class nodes in the Domain model represent key abstractions. It could be a re-install to a components. Again during the design workflow class nodes usually represent a physical software component. And a stereotype can help identify the type of the class node. Stereotype in UML can take one of the two forms either the textual form uses a word or a phrase surrounded by the less than and greater than, greater than, an example that we see here is entity, and the stereotype also can take an iconic form. For example, an entity can also be symbolized with a circle with a line under it, a circle over a line.**
