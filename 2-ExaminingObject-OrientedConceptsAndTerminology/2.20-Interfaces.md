# 2.20 - Interfaces

**Let us go ahead and look now at the interfaces. Well features of the Java technology interfaces are is the that you know interfaces do not contain attributes. So attributes are not permitted except constants, so interfaces by definitions do not have any attributes, however interfaces may again declare constants with the modified either public, static, and final. The methods are permitted, but they must be abstracts. So interfaces again are set of abstract methods, and interface may not declare a method with an implementation and constructors are not permitted in interfaces. So interfaces are not classes and no objects may be constructed from an interface, however a class might implement an interface, an object of that class may be said to be instances of the interface. Again however, it is more appropriate to say the instance supports the interface and of course sub interfaces may be defined forming an inheritance hierarchy of interfaces. So interfaces may have sub interfaces, therefore a set of interfaces might form a hierarchy. For example, the collections API in the java.util package includes a hierarchy of interfaces, the root interface is a collection with two sub interfaces list and set the set interface also has sub interface sorted set and so forth. And a class may implement one or more interfaces, so again this is sometimes called interface inheritance because the class inherits the methods of the interfaces. Again, if the class does not implement these methods, then it must be declared abstract.**
