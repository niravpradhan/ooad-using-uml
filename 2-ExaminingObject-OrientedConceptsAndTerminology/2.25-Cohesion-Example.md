# 2.25 - Cohesion: Example

**Let us go ahead and look at an example now that illustrates again the concept of cohesion. So in this case we have a class Sub services and/or System Services rather. And again we look at how actually it has low cohesion, so this class has functions that are completely unrelated. Logging in and out, manipulating Employees, and manipulating department, which are all different. So the classes on the right side on the other hand, you know once we split that SystemServices into three different classes, one is called the Login service and the other one is called the Employee service, and the third one is called the Partner service. So we see that these classes. Again we see how pretty much show refactoring of these subsystem or rather System services and again is divided into three different highly cohesive classes, where the Login service handles only the login and log out, the Employee service obviously manipulates only employees, and of course the Partner service manipulates the department or at least the methods in the EmployeeService are related to the employee and the methods in the Department service are related to the department.**
