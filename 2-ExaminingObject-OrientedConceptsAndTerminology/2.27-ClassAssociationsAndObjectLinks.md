**Moving along and now let us look at class associations and links. Well looking at the class associations, they have many dimensions. Again, these associations are discussed in greater detail later in the course. Before for now, we should again know about some of its features and these features are the roles that each class plays. So an association can be labeled with a role names. Again, these are the role names identify how each objects is related to the other. For example, the association between department and Employee has a role name of department next to the Department class. And the multiplicity of each role, again an association defines how many objects can participate in the association. For example in the association between department and employee, an employee has only one department, but a department can have one or more employee. So again we have the one that denotes exactly one and the one that that says one or more and the zero that says zero or more. And the direction or what we call navigability of the association again in our case here is also another dimension. So an association can define the navigability of an association. And again this is the path depending from one object to another. So for example from the department object, the system can navigate to any of the employees and from an employee the system can navigate to that person’s department. However again the structure specifies that the system can navigate from the manager to the manager’s department, however the department object cannot navigate to that department’s manager. So the idea is to look at the path leading from an object to another. And now looking at object links, again object links are instances of the class association. So just as objects are instances of classes, object links are instances of the class association. An object links are one-to-one relationships, again in one-to-many or many-to-many class relationship each link represents a connection from a single object to another single object.**
