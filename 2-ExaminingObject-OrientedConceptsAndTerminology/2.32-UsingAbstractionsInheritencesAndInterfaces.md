## Using Abstraction

**After looking at examining object oriented concepts and terminology where we looked at the object orientation, we are also looked at the surveying the fundamental OO concepts. Let us go ahead and look at an example that actually discusses the different features that we actually discuss in this particular module. And we will start with the first example that shows us how to use or making use of abstractions. Again, we will use abstraction on real world car object in this particular case. And we again must ensure that we keep only those responsibilities of the Car object that are relevant for every specified domain. And in this particular slide that we see, we actually have UML class description of a car and the first one which is the A1 is the car that in a Used Car Lot Business Context. So again, we see the attributes that are actual sale price make the model be purchasePrice and the requestedSalePrice. And our methods, we have to getProfit, reducedPrice, and of course sold. And if we get the look we see the data members, the attributes are private within the methods are public. And the class on the top right rather which represents the car in a Motor Racing Circuit Game Business Context. Again, we see that which is the B part and in this case and of course it has a bunch of attributes which are the currentSpeed, the maximumSpeed and the positionOnTrack , and then it has a couple of methods accelerate and the brake. And then the third one represents a car and thatâ€™s on the bottom left, that represents a car in a Vehicle Licensing Registration Business Context. Again, we see the attributes that are carbonDioxideEmissions, the make, the model, the registrationPlate, status, and the vehicleIDNumber. And of course the methods over there are declareAsNotUsedOnPublicHighway method and that is, of course, if it has a problem. And in the test and of course the registerAs Scrapped, and of course relicense which means that everything works fine in this particular case, and this shows us an example of the context of abstractions.**

## Using Inheritance

**The next slide actually talks about the concept of using inheritance. So in this case particular slide, we see how again this is related to a banking domain or a business context where we have an Account class that contains again a bunch of attributes and those are representing the account number and the balance and of course methods related to credit, debit, and getBalance. And from that account which is in this case plays a roll of the super class, we actually make use of inheritance and extend four different classes. The first one is called the saving account and as you see we actually in the SavingsAccount the business rules include the balance cannot go below zero, so that is why we overwrite the method debit. And we have the other class again which is called CheckingAccount that inherit from account and for the CheckingAccount, We again decided that for the business rules include that we may have an overdraft limit and if we have an overdraft limit and all the balance cannot drop below zero, but it cannot exceed that draft limit. And we see how in the CheckingAccount class, we actually have one extra attribute called the overdraftLimit. And of course, we overwrite the debit method for it too. And then we have another class that also extends the account or inherits from account and that is called the LoanAccount. So this LoanAccount class again whose business rules include that our balance cannot go above zero and we can debit only once. Again, that is when the current account is opened. And we see that we have a debited attribute added to the loan account. And of course, we overwrite the credit and the debit method of that particular class. And the forth class that we see again within the contexts of inheritance is the TaxFreeSavingAccount. And that again we see that it inherits from SavingsAccount. And we see that its business ruling in that particular case include that we have an annual credit limit and we cannot credit more than that amount every year. And that is we see an extra attribute in addition to the ones that exist in the savings account. We have the unusedAnnualCreditLimit and of course we override its credit method.**

## Using Delegation

**The other slide that I want to show this time actually is related to using delegation and cohesion. So we see in this particular case then we will delegate coherent responsibilities to classes by using class associations and of course inheritance. So in this particular class diagram, we see how we have a Bank and class on the top right and that bank class actually is associated with one or more branches, again, it has branches. And we see on the Bank class we have the bankName attribute, and then in the Branch, we have the branchCodeIdentifier that identifies the branch of the particular bank. We also have an association between the branch and the address, of course, every branch has an address. In this case would be the building, the City, Street, and ZipCode. And also the Branch has an association with the Account. Again, a Branch has zero or more Account. So again the Account here has the accountNumber and a balance. And of course, a bunch of operations which are credit, debit, and getBalance. But also we have we see a class called Customer, and then of course that Customer has an association also with the address class II because every Customer has an address. And also a Customer has an association between it and the account class. Again, a Customer can have one or more Accounts, but then from the Customer class we now use inheritance and of course create two classes that extend the Customer. One is called the BusinessCustomer and other one is called PersonalCustomer. Again for the BusinessCustomer, it has an attribute called companyRegistrationNumber and for the customer we have an attribute that represents the taxReferenceNumber. So a taxReferenceNumber can may be associate security number for example.**

## Using Interfaces

**The next slide represents an example that actually discusses the concept of the benefits of using interfaces. So in this particular case, we actually are asked to write the software system that can be used to buy and sell property, but then we decided to delegate the buy and sell behavior that is specific to properties to a PropertyTradingService class. And we see the PropertyTradingService class over there, but also again that include the buy and sell methods, but now we actually have been asked to ensure that this software system is able to support the trading of different types of items such as vehicles, stock market shares. So the question in this case is we need to draw the class diagram that describes the classes and interfaces that will be required to provide flexible solutions to the problem that we discussed. Again, we should ensure that new types of item can be added to the software system with minimal changes to the existing software system. And of course looking for this flexibility that actually lead us to making use of the interfaces. And so we see here we have an interface called TradingServices and it has the method buy and sell which actually need to be implemented. And we have now the GenericTradingSoftware that actually makes use of that interface, the TradingService interface. And now what we have done we actually made the classes called a PropertyTradingService and the StockMarketTradingService and the VehicleTradingService that actually will implement the InterfaceTradingServices. So we see the PropertyTradingService will implement the buy and sell method. The StockMarketShareTradingService which also implement the buy and sell methods and the VehicleTradingService also that implement the buy and sell methods. And of course, looking at this diagram here, this class diagram, we can actually create any other class that will implement the trading service. So in this sense we can add a new types of items that can be traded quite easily just by having classes implement the sell and buy methods of the trading service.**
