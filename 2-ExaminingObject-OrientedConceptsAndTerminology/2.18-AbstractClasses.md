**Now looking at Abstract Class. Well a class that contains one or more abstract methods and therefore can never be instantiated that is typically the definition that we have from again the Sun glossary. Well features of the abstract classes are that the attributes are permitted, so we have you know again an abstract class may declare instance variables, these attributes are inherited by the super classes rather the subclasses of the abstract class. Also some of the features of the abstract classes is that methods are permitted and some might be declared abstract, again methods may be declared in an abstract class, one or more of the methods might also be declared abstract meaning that this class does not actually define an implementation of those methods and also constructors are permitted but no client may directly instantiate an abstract class, so constructors may be declared in an abstract class again this constructors can be used by the constructors of the sub classes, however the existence of constructors in an abstract class does not mean that the class may be instantiated, so instances cannot be created because one or more methods are abstract. And of course some of the other features of the abstract classes is that subclasses of abstract classes must provide implementations of all abstract methods, otherwise these subclass must also be declared abstract. So again, subclasses of abstract classes may implement any of the abstract methods in its abstract super class. Again the subclass may also override any non-abstract methods in the abstract super class, however if the subclass does not provide implementations of all abstract methods, then that subclass must also be declared as abstract and in the unified modeling language a method or a class is denoted as abstract by using italic or by appending method name or a class name with the word abstract between curly braces. Again it is difficult to use italics in handwritten drawings, again which stands to use the abstract notation rather than again writing it in italic.**
