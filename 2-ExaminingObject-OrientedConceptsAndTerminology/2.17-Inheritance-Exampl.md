# 2.17 - Inheritance: Example

**And the next slide here that we see currently illustrates an example of inheritance hierarchy as we see again this is related to the HR example that has been extended with a new type of Employee Manager. So in this case, we have an Employee and that has a first name and a last name and a salary and of course this class which is the super class Employee has a bunch of methods, getFirstName, getLastName, and increaseSalary. And then from it we actually extend to two classes one is called Manager and the other one is called Engineer. So in Manager, we saw the Manager class will inherit all the data members of the employee plus its methods, the super class Employee and of course we added its own features. We added actually data member called quarterlyBonus which is again of type money and we also have now a couple of methods that are added which are the increaseBonus and playGolf WithClient method, but if we take a look we see the increaseSalary method that is also appears on in the Manager class. What it means is that that increaseSalary method will overwrite the method of the super class that we see in this case the increaseSalary in the super class Employee. Now looking at the other class Engineer, which also extends Employee; we see also couple of data members that are added specific to Engineer and their education with soft type string and hardware of type string. Again, hardware that the Engineer uses to do their job and the education what type of education they have work for and we also see a bunch of methods too. We see getEducation, getHardware and analyze you know request for example or analyze requirements, designSoftware and implementCode, and what we do not see is increaseSalary, so obviously in this case the engineer will inherit or make use of the increaseSalary that is implemented in the super class Employee.**
