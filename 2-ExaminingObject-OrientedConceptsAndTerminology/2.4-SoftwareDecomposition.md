**Now looking at software decomposition, which is pretty much the second issue that we said we need to discuss. Well in procedural programming tasks are decomposed into hierarchy of procedures. Again as we see on the figure that we have on this current slide is an example of hierarchy of procedures for managing human resources tasks such as giving a promotion or a raise. So we see we have a manage HR activities and then if you can give employee a promotion or give a department employees a raise. And then underneath the give employee a promotion, you can actually give a manager promotion or give an engineer promotion and the same thing and the give department employees a raise that would be give a manager raise or give an engineer a raise. So this decomposition seems natural until you try to extend the program. Again for example how would you support a new type of employees such as lab technicians if this type of employee requires unique actions for a give a raise and give a promotion. Then the procedural hierarchy must be modified in several places. Again this is the definition of brittle. Now again in OO paradigm software is decomposed in the hierarchy of interactive components usually objects. So our figure that we see on this current slide shows an example of object hierarchy. On the right, the department object delegates to the employee objects to perform a give raise action. Each employee object has a type defined by the class hierarchy on the left. So we see department and then departments are made of employees and those employees could be a manager or an engineer. Now looking at the objects so we have the HR services object that give a department raise. So we have an IT for example department in this case we see an object and then we have the increased salary and that could be to the different object that we see over there in this case the employs either Cathy who is a manager, Fred is an engineer or Samantha who is also an engineer.**
