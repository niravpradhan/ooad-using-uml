**Let us go ahead and look at Cohesion now. Well cohesion is the measure of how much an entity meaning a component or a class supports a singular purpose within assistant. so in software the concept or cohesion refers to how well a given component or method supports a single purpose. And the aspects of cohesion are that we should have low cohesion that occurs when a component is responsible for many unrelated features. Again, the classes with many unrelated methods tend to be had to maintain. High cohesions on the other hand occurs when a component is responsible for only one set of related features, so that is why we say that is more classes with fewer, but highly related methods tend to be easier to maintain and of course a component includes one or more classes. Therefore, cohesion applies to a single class or subsystem or a system and cohesion also applies to other aspects including methods and packages. So components that do everything are often described with the Anti-Patterns of again blobbed components.**
