**Continuing with again the oral concepts, let us go ahead and look at Coupling. Well coupling is the degree to which classes within our systems are dependent on each other. So coupling refers to the degree to which one class makes use of another class. Again, the typical example is of a client class that uses a service class and again in some cases a client class never uses a service class. Again, this is called No Coupling. A more interesting case is when the client class that uses a concrete service class. Again, this is called Loose Coupling because the client class has intimate knowledge of the service class. So finally, Tight Coupling occurs when both the client and the service depend upon each other. Again, we see that the left side you know on this case, the four Tight Coupling, a client depends on services and the service depends on client. Again, on the current diagram that we see on this current slide we see on again the left side we see three cases of the No Coupling, or Loose Coupling, or Tight Coupling. On the right side, on the other hand ,it shows the two variations on a form of coupling called Abstract Coupling. Again, in this situation, the client requires the use of service, but it does not know what concrete class is supplying that service. So again, the Java programming language supports to Abstract Coupling mechanisms. One mechanism is to create an abstract service class and then one or more concrete supplier classes again which extends the service class. Alternatively you also could create a service interface and then one or more concrete supplier classes again which implements that service interface. So we should note that Abstract Coupling is an example of the dependency inversion principle which is covered later in this course.**
