**Let us go ahead and start with objects. Well an object is always specified or defined with its on state and behavior. So an object has a state, behaviour, and identity and the structure and behavior of similar objects are defined in their common class which is the blueprint of the objects. Well objects are runtime features of an OO systems and typically objects have identity, so every object are runtime has an identity that is unique and is independent of its attribute values. And of course objects are an instance of only one class, so a class defines a type of object, a runtime an object defined by one class, however that class might be an extension of other classes as a result of using inheritance. Also objects have attribute values that are unique to that object. What we mean by that is that every object of the same class has the same set of attributes, but the values of this attributes are unique for every object. This means that you can change an attribute of one account object without affecting any other account object in memory. Also we should say that objects have methods that are common to the class. What we mean by that is that the operations or actions of an object are defined by the set of methods that are implemented in the objects class or an ancestor class.**
