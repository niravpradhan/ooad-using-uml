# 2.28 - Class Associations and Object Links: Example

**And looking at the next diagram this shows us a Class Association and Object Links: Example. So the top diagram that we see here shows a set of classes and their associations. So the Department class is associated with one or more objects of the Employee class and the Manager class is associated with one and only one object of the Department class. The bottom diagram shows an example of a group of objects and their runtime links at a particular moment in time. So the IT Department contains three employees and Kathy is the manager of the IT department. If we add another employee or subtype to the department then the bottom object diagram would actually change provided that the multiplicity constraints of the top class diagram allow the change.**
