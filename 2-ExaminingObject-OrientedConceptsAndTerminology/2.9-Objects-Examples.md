**Moving along and now what we are going to do is look at an example. Well the example that we see on this current slide illustrates an example of Account Object. So if we take a look at this slide you will see that are the graph or the diagram that we see on this class, you see that the outer box represent aspects of a programs runtime environment. The Stack box which is the lower rectangle represents the current extension frame or the Stack frame with program variables for that frame. And in this example as we see on the current slide the account variable holds a reference to the Account object. Again, we see that the objects rather the objects box which is the upper right rectangle represents the space in memory that holds objects, that is of course usually called the hint.**
