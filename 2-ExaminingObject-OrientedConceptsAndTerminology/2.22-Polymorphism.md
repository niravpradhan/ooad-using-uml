**Let us look at Polymorphism. Well polymorphism is a concept in type fury according to which a name such as a variable declaration may denote object of many different classes that are related by some common super class. And the aspects of polymorphism are the fact that a variable declared to a reference type T can be assigned different types of objects or runtime provided, they are subtype of the variables type T. So as we saw we know that the Employee variable can reference any type of object whose class is proper super class of Employee. Again, polymorphism can be used with variables which are local and instance that could be method parameters and method return values and the other aspect of polymorphism is that the method implementation is determined by the type of object not the type of the declaration. So dynamic binding works by looking up the method based on the signature within the declared methods for the actual class of the object not the apparent type. Again if the method is not found in that class then the language environment performs the look up on the super class, if the method is not found in the super class than the method look up is performed on the super classes sub super class, and so on. Also another aspect of polymorphism is that only method signatures defined by the variable type can be called without casting. So a method signature is the name of the method along with its parameters. Again a variable declared to reference type T can only be used to call methods that are supported by type T, again using the example we can look at some later on in the example to look at the different again method signature defined by the variable type that can be called without casting.**
