**Let us go ahead and look at Examining Object Orientation. Well OO concepts affect the whole development process starting with gathering requirements, then getting into domain modeling then design and of course, after that implementation. And looking at again some of the considerations that we need to link into when we are examining object orientation and these again considerations would be that humans think in terms of nouns which are objects and verbs which are behaviors of objects. So, human languages and thought patterns are formed around objects in the world, such as again people, places, and things, and around the actions that manipulate the world of objects. Of course OO principles with our focus on objects and what actions these objects perform in terms of their responsibilities. With OO Software Development or Object-Oriented Software Development, both problem and solution domains are modeled using OO concepts. So in OO Software Development the development team is asked to create a software system that supports a business process. Again these processes are modeled with object responsibilities and collaborations that we are going to look into in one of the modules of this course later on. The unified modeling language is a de facto standard for modeling OO software; again, although not essential it is useful to be able to visualize OO concepts in terms of views and models. As a consequence, a defect or graphical notation called UML has evolved. Again, the UML was designed to model many OO aspects including objects, responsibilities, and collaborations; therefore the UML is a good tool for visualizing our mental models. OO languages bring the implementation closer to the language of mental models. Again, the UML is a good bridge between mental models and implementation. And various OO languages provide language syntax such as class definitions and Semantic structures such as runtime objects based on OO principles. Of course, the UML has mappings for many mainstream OO languages such as the Java programming language. Mayors said in his book that software systems perform certain actions on objects of certain types to obtain flexible and reusable systems, it is better to base their structure on the object types than on the actions. Again, the OO concepts affect a bunch of issues, which are stated here on this current slide a software complexity, software decomposition, and software costs.**
