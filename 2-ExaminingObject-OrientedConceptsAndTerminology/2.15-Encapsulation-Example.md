# 2.15 - Encapsulation: Example

**And in this next slide we actually see the illustrations of an example of encapsulation using the Engineer class. Again we should notice that the attributes that have been declared private indicated by the minus sign, before the attribute name and of course we see an accessor methods such as getFirstName and mutator methods such as setFirstName that have been declared within the class. And if you take a look at the diagram we see that we cannot actually assign value directly to name attribute and employ attribute directly simply because or alter the value of name and employee simply because they are set as private. But on the other hand, if we take a look below the diagram, you see on the right side with the check with the green check mark that says you can actually affect the value or modify the value of the attribute name and the employee through or rather read the value of the name and employee through the getter methods, which is getFirstName and setFirstName. On the other hand, on the left side we see that when we access the first name of the employee object and try to actually read it, we cannot do that and of course we cannot also assign any type of a value to those attributes and we see that in the employee.fname which we wanted to set with Samantha and obviously we cannot do that. We have to do that either through in our case here we can read the data through the getFirstName and we can set or modify the value of the first name through the setFirstName.**
