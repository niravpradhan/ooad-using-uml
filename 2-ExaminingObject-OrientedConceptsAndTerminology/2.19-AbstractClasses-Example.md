**Now moving along and now looking at an example again in this current slide. It actually illustrates an example of abstract class. So w
e have the Employee class in this HR example that has been declared as abstract and we see it first of all it is written in italic and second we see the label over there are the abstract label that we see between curly braces on right underneath the Employee on the right side. And of course you know this is Employee class which is again declared as an abstract, we can see also in it the method increaseSalary, okay which also abstract and why because again it does not provide an implementation for that. So the Manager and the Engineer classes must implement that method which is the increaseSalary and that is why if you take a look at the concrete classes that again extend Employee the abstract class Employee, Manager, and Engineer both of them if you take a look they actually implement the increaseSalary method plus their own specific methods and data members.**
