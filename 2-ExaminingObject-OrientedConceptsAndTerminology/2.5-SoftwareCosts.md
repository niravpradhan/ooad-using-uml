**Let us look at the third issue affected by the OO concepts and this would be the Software Costs. Well OO principles can reduce development costs by having the OO principles provide a natural technique for modeling business entities and processes from the early stages of a project. OO development is an improvement over procedural development because we can model software that maps closely to your mental model. Also OO-modeled business entities and processes are easier to implement in OO languages. So building software in an OO language also increases productivity by enabling the programmers to write code that maps closely to the design models and the OO principles can also reduce maintenance costs and that again in a way you have your changeability and flexibility and adoptability of software is important to keep software running for a long time. And Mayor states in his book that it is widely estimated that 70% of the cost of software is devoted to maintenance. And that the bulk of the maintenances effort is in of course changes to user requirements and changes in data formats. OO-modeled business entities and processes can be adapted to new functional requirements, so designs are easier to change in response to new business requirements. And of course OO designs focus on identifying the stable business objects that can be made to interact in new ways.**
