**Let us go ahead and look at Classes. Well a class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. And of course, in OO programming a class is usually a language construct that forms the common structure and behavior from which objects are instantiated. And of course the classes provide a bunch of features. And again this feature would be that the metadata for attributes. Again, the class does not hold data, the objects hold the data, but however the class maintains the metadata of each attribute. Again, this metadata includes the data type and the initial values if specified. Also classes provide the signature of methods again what it means is that the operations or actions of an object are usually called methods in OO terminology. And methods have two elements again signature and implementation. The signature includes the name of the method, the list of parameters, again parameter name and type, and the return type. We should also say that classes provide the implementation of the methods. Again, the implementation of a method is the set of programming statements that specify how the operation is to be performed. And also classes provide the constructors to initialize attributes at creation time, again a constructor is a set of instructions that initializes an instance. Again in Java programming languages, it support, you know, as we know constructors.**
