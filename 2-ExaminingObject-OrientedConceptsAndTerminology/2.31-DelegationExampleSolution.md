# 2.31 - Delegation: Example Solution

**Well this slide shows one possible solution that actually separates these two aspects and associates the two classes. Again, in this case, the Employee will delegate the job role to the job role class that is subclass into Engineer and Manager. So if you take a look here now we have this new job role class which is an abstract class and from it now we subclass directly the Manager and of course Engineer as job roles. So again in this case the Employee calls the jobRole.increaseSalary method to be able actually or they increaseSalary method of the job role to decide about the increaseSalary either for a manager role or an engineer role. We should also say that as this is an introduction, we actually have not covered all the aspects of delegation. For example, we have not covered having multiple delegates such as rows or types, these aspects will be covered later in the course and we also should know that delegation is not only for rows. It has many other discriminators for example types.**
