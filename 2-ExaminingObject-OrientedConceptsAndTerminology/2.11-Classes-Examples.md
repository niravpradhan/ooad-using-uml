# 2.11 - Classes: Examples

**Now moving along and looking at an example on this current slide and that this example again illustrates an example Account Class. We should notice that the operations have now been placed with the class rather than with the object. Classes hold methods and objects hold data. So objects execute methods by looking up the method implementation in the class. And as you see on this current slide, we see classes on the upper left rectangle and represents where we see the metadata for the state or the data of the represented in the class and of course we see the methods which are credit, debit, and getBalance and of course from that class which is the blueprint we can instantiate objects and we see for example on the upper right rectangle we see our box. We see the two objects, one is the source of type account and the other one is the destination of type account, but this time we see over there the data that actually now has values. For example, the number, the balance and the type now they have values and of course this illustrates how you know obviously in this case, the objects can be instantiated from their class or their blueprint and in the lower rectangle we see the sourceAccount and the destinationAccount. Those are object references to the both the sourceAccount and the destinationAccount.**
