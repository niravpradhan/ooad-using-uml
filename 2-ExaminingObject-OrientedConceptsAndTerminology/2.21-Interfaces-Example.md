# 2.21 - Interfaces: Example

**Now moving along and let us go ahead now and look at an example of these interfaces. so the current slides illustrates an example of this interface which is again related to the HR example that has been extended to include an interface for scheduling resources, such as people rooms, and equipments. So if you take a look here we see that the Employee and Equipment classes implement the schedulable interface and if you take a look at the association representing the implementation you see actually the dotted lines that you see between the Employee and Equipment and the Employee and sub schedulable interface and the Equipment has schedulable interface and even ConfRoom which represents conference room and the schedule interface. So you see the dotted lines and then the arrow towards the schedule, this means the Employee implements the schedulable interface and the Equipment also object implements the schedule interface and of course the conference room implements the schedulable interface. Again because so looking again at the Employee and Equipment classes which implement this schedulable interface again because these two classes are the route of a class hierarchy any subclass of either of these super classes are also schedulable. So the Room for example, the Room class hierarchy is different because the system should not be permitted to actually schedule activities for any arbitrary room such as an Office or closed and so forth. However, conference rooms need to be scheduled. And of course therefore the conference room class implements the schedule of an interface and dependent of the other class in the rooms hierarchy. Again in our case here, we can say that a Manager can be scheduled and then Engineer can be scheduled, you know may be working on particular project for some time for six months or whatever the same thing a projector or computer can be scheduled, you know for a particular project or a task. And a conference room also can be scheduled and if you take a look at the scheduled interface, it contains couple of methods; getobjectID and then notifyAboutActivity. So again those methods which are abstract need to be implemented by the classes that implement the interface.**
