**Now looking at Inheritance. Well inheritance is an mechanism whereby a class is defined in reference to others. Again adding all the features to its own this is again said by Mayor in his book. And the features of inheritance are that the attributes and methods from the super class are included in the subclass. Again, because managers and engineers share some common attributes, name and salary and so forth, the super class Employee is defined to hold these common attributes and operations. Again the Engineer and Manager subclasses inherit all the features of the super class plus again these classes can extend the super class with new features specific to that particular type of Employee. Also we should say that subclass methods can override super class methods, again we should notice that the increaseSalary method is declared by the Employee class. Again this declaration means that the subclasses will inherit these default behavior, however the Manager class also includes the increaseSalary method. Again, this declaration means that an object of type Manager will use its own implementation to get a race. You should also say that there are a bunch of conditions that must be true for the inheritance relationship to again be possible and these would be a subclass object is a kind of the super class object. Again using is a kind of test helps you avoid using the inheritance or relationship when it is either inappropriate now or in the future. Also inheritance should confirm to the list of substitution principle which is called the principle LSP. Again this principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987. Again, the brief simplified interpretation is that if you substitute a class for example an Engineer for super class for example Employee than any code that expects to use the super class should have no surprises from a behavior point of view. Now following continuing with inheritance and now we are going to look at is again you should specify that specific OO languages allow either of again the following where a single inheritance which allow a class to directly inherit from only one super class and that is typically done in Java and multiple inheritance which allows the class to directly inherit from one or more super classes and that is actually is often seen in C++.**
