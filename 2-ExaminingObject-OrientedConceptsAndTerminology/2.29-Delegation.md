**Moving along and now let us look at Delegation. Well many computing problems can be easily solved by delegation to a more cohesive component again one or more classes or method. And delegation is similar to how we human behave. For example, a manager often delegates tasks to an employee with appropriate skills of course. You often delegate plumbing problem to a plumber or a car delegates accelerate break and steer messages to each subcomponents. Again, who in turn delegate messages to their subcomponents and so forth. So this delegation of messages eventually affects the engine breaks and wheel direction respectively. An OO paradigms frequently mimic the real world. So the ways you delegate in OO paradigm include again delegating to a more cohesive linked objects, a collection of cohesive linked methods, a method in a subclass, a method in a super class, a method in the same class.**
