**Let's look at Abstraction. Well abstraction is something that summarizes and concentrates the essentials of a larger thing, so in OO software the concept of abstraction enables you to create simplified but relevant view of real word object within the context of the problem and solution domains. Of course, the abstraction object is a presentation of the real world object with irrelevant behavior and data remote. And of course the abstraction object is representation of real word object with currently irrelevant behavior and data hidden. So abstraction is a fundamental OO concept, because finding the right abstractions enable you to design just those features defined by the system requirements and to ignore all other details that are irrelevant to the problem being solved.**
