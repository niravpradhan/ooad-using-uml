**Now let us go and look at the comparison between the Procedural and OO Paradigms. Well many programming paradigms have risen over the past half century. Again, these include assembler, which is the machine language, procedural, OO, functional, rule based. Again to name only few, but procedural and OO are the leading paradigms in the software industry. Again, here on starting with this current slide we want to compare the procedural and OO Paradigms. And we set them in a table where we specify the Procedural Paradigm view and the OO paradigm view. So we start first with the organizational structure. Well from the Procedural Paradigm point of view, the organizational structure focuses on hierarchy of procedures and sub procedures. Again, data is separate from procedures. And this is when we talk about the procedural programming language. On the other hand, if you look at it from the OO paradigm view, the network of collaborating objects obviously. So you would be not a form of network collaborating objects and methods which are processes are often bound together with the state data of the object. Let us go and look at now the protection against modification or access. From the Procedural Paradigm point of view data is difficult to protect against inappropriate modifications or access when it is passed to or referenced by many different procedures. Again, here looking at the Procedural Paradigm point of view. On the other hand, if you look at the OO Paradigm point of view we see that the data and internal methods of objects can be protected against inappropriate modifications or access by using encapsulation. And which we by the way we looked at in the next few slides. Let us go ahead and look at the ability to modify software. From the Procedural Paradigm point of view, it can be expensive and difficult to make software that is easy to change. Again resulting in many brittle systems. On the other hand if you look at it from the OO paradigm view, we see that a robot software that is easy to change if written using good OO principles and parents. Let us look at the reuse now concept. Well reuse from the Procedural Paradigm point of view, reuse of methods is often achieved by copy and paste. On the other hand, from the OO paradigm point of view, reuse of code by again it is the way we reuse the code is we use generate components one or more objects with well-defined interfaces. Again, that is achieved by extension of classes. In our case here would be extension is represented by inheritance or interfaces again or by composition of objects. Moving along and again comparing all the procedural and OO Paradigms, let us look now at the configuration of special cases. From the procedural point of view, it often requires if or switch statement. Again, modification is risky because it often requires altering existing code. So modifications must be done with extreme care apart from requiring extensive regression testing. Again, these factors make even minor changes costly to implement. Now looking at it from the OO paradigm point of view we see that the polymorphic behavior can facilitate the possibility of modifications being primarily additive, subtractive, or substitution of whole component, one or more objects of course. There by reducing the associated risks and cost.**
