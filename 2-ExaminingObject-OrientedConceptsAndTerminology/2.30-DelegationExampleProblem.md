**Let us look at an example about delegation. So on this current slide the example that we see illustrates one of the many problems that delegation can solve. Again, the figure that we see on this slide shows the example that we have seen earlier with some additional classes added. Again, these are just a few of the additional classes whose objects might have links to the Employee objects at some time. Again, in this business problem, it is likely that employees change their job roles. For example, an Engineer might be promoted to a manager, however, you cannot change your class, so for an Engineer to be promoted to a Manager which again we would have to again in this case create a new object of type manager and copy the common attribute values which is the first name, last name, and salary to the new object and of course ask all of the objects that used the Engineer object to replace that link with link to the manager object and of course delete the engineer object. We should also note that we have not addressed the issues of keeping a historical record of an employeeâ€™s employment of course. So in this case we have the Employee which is an abstract class. From it we extend the Manager class in the Engineer class and we see also have we have the also classes the Sports And Social Club and the Pension Scheme class and the Human Resources class, but again interact with Employee class. The problem in this example is because the details of job roles and non-job roles are mixed together which is not again coherent. So to solve this problem, we look now on the next slide.**
