**So with that we looked at this first module which pretty much took us through the object orientation which is a model of computation that is closer to how humans think about problems. And then of course we looked at using an OO paradigm for developing systems again that has many benefits over procedural development, because of the closer mapping between your mental models and your analysis and design models and your implementation of course. And we also looked at the OO that provides a set of these fundamental concepts that we went through like a object, class, abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding, inheritance, abstract classes, we looked at interfaces, we looked at polymorphism, we looked at cohesion, we looked at coupling, we looked at class annotation and object links, and we looked at delegation. Of course these OO concepts are the bases of most OO principles and patterns used throughout this course.**
