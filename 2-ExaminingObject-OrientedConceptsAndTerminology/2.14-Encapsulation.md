**Now let us go ahead and look at Encapsulation. Well looking at encapsulation we can say that encapsulation means to enclose in or us if in a capsule. That is again from the Webster dictionary. Encapsulation is an essential property of an object. An object as a programming construct is a capsule that holds the objects internal state within its boundary. Again, most OO languages such as Java programming language have encapsulation build into the language itself. Again, in most OO languages the term encapsulation also include information hiding which can be defined as hide implementation details behind the set of non-private methods. Again, it is this aspect of encapsulation that most programmers think of. Because in order to create a proper encapsulation, you must do couple of things. First, make all attributes private and provide accessors and mutator methods to provide an abstract interface to the data held within the object capsule.**
