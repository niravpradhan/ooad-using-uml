# 2.23 - Polymorphism: Example

**Well let us look at the example that we see now again in this particular example which illustrates the concept of polymorphic behavior. Again in our case here the list contains three objects. In our case here, one Manager and two Engineers and we can see actually the class on the upper left side and the class hierarchy where we have an Employee, we have a Manager, and Engineer with subclass Employee and then the objects that we see on the upper right side that would be the instance Kathy of type Manager, and the instance Fred of type Engineer, and the instance Samantha of type Engineer. So again looking at the list, which contains these three objects, one Manager, two Engineers, however in the code the Employee variable is declared only as employee or of type Employee, so how does the system know which increaseSalary method to call. Again, the runtime environment finds the class of the actual object to determine which method to call. Again this language features is called dynamic binding and so we see again in the code how we are actually making use of the type Employee, but we know that the binding is done at run time to decide which again increaseSalary methods is the one of the manager or one of the engineer and we know that the implementation of the increaseSalary between the Manager class and the Engineer class are different.**

**Again continuing with the polymorphism example, again this slide now illustrates an example using interfaces, so the schedule class that we see over there enables any kind of schedulable objects to be added to a schedule. Therefore, employee objects, equipment objects, and conference room object, might be added to a schedule. Okay and we see it on the diagram, how actually we can have either an employee that can be scheduled or equipment that can be scheduled or a conference room that can be scheduled.**
